Japan part II of ∞. What felt like a pipedream was now a reality. My friends and I were in talks about this trip for the longest time but we didn’t walk the walk. I kept prolonging anything from happening because I was waiting for cheap fares, but <a href="https://youtu.be/GsebMOWQiYM?t=30s">I was a _foool_</a>. It didn't help that shifts were scarce, leaving funding for the trip waning as days went on. And maaaaaybe it didn't help that I was spending so frivolously <sub>(still do to this day)</sub>. BUT! Through the bleak clouds of doubt came a ray of sunshine called action.

It was an early September morning where I thought to myself, “what better way to start the season than to _spring_ into action”. Now there weren’t any sales or promotions active at the time but I made the decision to book the flights anyway. That’s not to say I rashly came to that decision. I looked around <sub>...for a good couple of minutes.</sub> 

やった! We walked the walk.

A common weakness in myself is that I’m uncannily too organised for my own good and, of course, I devised the _ULTIMATE_ itinerary <sub><sub>…to fade from existence.</sub></sub> In my previous trip to Japan, I only had the chance to experience Tokyo and its encompassing areas (i.e. Hakone, Nikko). However, with the _ULTIMATE_ itinerary in hand, I was given the chance to experience a broader range of what Japan had to offer.

<img src="{{ baseurl }}/assets/img/P001/02.gif"/>

Day in and day out, I spent some time building up the itinerary. It’s hard to forget My Account fun I had when I discovered each fact or tid-bits about each location, or be inspired to capture the treasurable landmarks and memories to come. All while amping myself up more and more… for months on end... An unfortunate dichotomy between pleasure and pain.

Side tracking for a bit // If you’re planning to visit Japan, I suggest trying out Flight Centre <sub>(shout out to best rep: Jared Hunter)</sub> for your ticketing needs (though I can't comment on what pricing is for non-Australian branches). We went through them for the JR National Pass (21 days) and Universal Studios Japan entry ticket. They were able to edge out the competition that had, what I found, "cheap" prices already.

For Wi-Fi, I used <a href="https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/services/pocket-wifi">Japan Rail Pass</a>. Between the five of us, it came out to be 30 odd dollars for the three weeks. It had unlimited data, battery lasted more than a day being fully on and could connect a multitude of devices. Not to mention it’s faster than most “broadband” solutions back home… <sub><sub>*thanks, Libs.*</sub></sub>

My final recommendation is 1Cover for insurance. Comprehensive cover for the group got the price going cheaper per head and it was quite competitive at $0 excess compared to other companies. But wait! There’s more! They are listed on Cashrewards <sub>($5 if you sign up with <a href="http://fbuy.me/dQRlW">my link</a>. Not a scam, I swear)</sub>. On top of a low price, you can get a whopping 6.4% back. Pretty neat :smirk:. Do note that the funds are only available 90 days after the end date (if it’s not, the staff will kindly help out). Now this isn’t just a <sup>(non-paid)</sup> sales pitch for 1Cover <sup>(or Cashrewards... use my link).</sup> I can vouch that they are someone worth going with for travel insurance because they have what you need at a relatively low price. Case in point, we had a costly hiccup during the trip and 1Cover reimbursed us for the bill in a timely and pleasant manner. // Back on track now.

While this trip would have been fantastic by myself, it was exponentially better thanks to the accompaniment of my dear friends – the cream of the crop. Hand selected for ~~their love of Japan, strong rapport, and~~ being the only ones available <sub>(time-ly and fiscally)</sub>. That left me with Alex, Carolyn, Vivian, and Wilson - each contributing their unique personalities and traits to make the trip better <sub><sub>or worse <sub>(100% worse).</sub></sub></sub>

With a miscellany of things booked, I only had to <a href="https://youtu.be/SQWqksdE4gw?t=1m22s">work, <sub>work, work, <sub>work, work…</sub></sub></a>And save what I earned <sub>earned, earned, <sub>earned, earned…</sub></sub> (HAH! Hello new lens*es*, LEE filters, tablet, memory cards…).

:fast_forward: past the anguish and quickly to 13.12.16, the day we had been waiting for all that time.

As per usual for me, on a night before anything that was remotely eventful, I barely got in a wink of sleep. And silly ‘ol me didn’t realise until later that instead of just lying in bed trying to sleep, it was better to *do* something. 

Last minute triple checks and a carpool ride later, the gang was physically together for the first time. Cue the usual dreary airport routine. This time round though… it was surprisingly quick. It’s just that when I am travelling with my dad in the mix, time and space just ceases indefinitely.

It was a good start with the flight to Brisbane. Time being docked and in the air felt short enough and the food was edible. Maybe the flight experience won’t be so bad this time. *Wrong, so so wrong*. The events that transpired after touching down were nothing but misery. Signage around the airport were minimal and unhelpful to say the least. Getting to the international port was such a hassle travelling back and forth, between the differing sectors.

Compounding on my petty misery was the painstakingly slow security clearance. Alex was “lucky” enough to join the body scanner line (a.k.a. the express lane). Meanwhile, I waited ever so patiently for things to move along (if at all). It wasn’t the time for patience though… boarding time was just around the corner and I still needed to make a TRS claim (the best. I was able to get a lens (normally retailing at $700-800 for $430ish thanks to the store’s discount, Cashrewards <sup>(use my link)</sup>, the Fujifilm cashback AND now the TRS claim. Weeew~ that transaction totalled a little over 50% in discounts! On a lens! BUT! I was dogged <sub>(as usual)</sub> because not much later did the 100th 20% eBay [insert category] sale pop up… imagine the savings with *THAT* sale). Backtrack to now, I was able to sweep through security without a hitch and unlike those before me, I did it quickly :unamused:. After filing the claim <sub>(thank you self-service postal option)</sub>, we hurried to the gate juuust in time. We proceeded to our respective seats and settled in, ever so eager to reach our destination.

This flight had nothing going for me. The film/T.V. selection was meh and the music range...:no_mouth: I stuck to my own player. Seating felt smaller and cramped than the domestic flight! And because of this, sleep was rendered virtually impossible. The flight was 9hrs and I was practically awake... for all of it. With no sleep the night before, this was just dandy.

Sleep wasn’t my only problem :unamused:. Meals? I was practically starving myself. In previous flights, I didn’t have much of a problem with airline food but lately, that’s been changing for the worst. I cannot stand the stuff (and that putrid airport/aeroplane smell. bleugh). I don’t know if it’s because I just chose the crappier option each time but every meal provided was foul. So now I am deprived of sleep and nutrition. Juuust dandy…

With 15mins left, I decided *now* was a good time to brush up on my Japanese... 3 years ago was the last time I practiced the language... when I studied it in high school. The plan was to become fluent post high school but I left it in the back of my mind. Aaand it wasn’t happening now either… even if I did manage to learn some new things, it hardly contributed to the bigger picture.

_FINALLY_, we arrived at Narita Airport <sub>(not long after booking the flights did I realise the existence of Haneda Airport… it's much closer to Tokyo and nearer to the popular districts…shhii-)</sub>. Boooy did we spend a lot of time here… <sub>(not due to any fault of mine… :kissing:)</sub> While customs and baggage collection was quick, the time killers were all the events thereafter.

First up was the collection of the pocket Wi-Fi. According to the 2x2 px low-res map provided, it was on the third floor at a post office. Simple, right? Yeah… *naaah*. I got to use my dodgy Japanese sooner rather than later. I walked up to a security-esque person and asked where this (pointing at map) was. The man eloquently instructed where we needed to go and I nodded in agreement. As you may have figured out, I registered nothing. Trying to zero in on key words, left me forgetting what he actually relayed to me :joy:. Striding back to my friends in a faux-confidence, I informed them of my pitiful exchange.

It was okay though, since we just needed to get up to the third floor and ask around from there. I was given a large envelope with the small Wi-Fi unit inside. Also included was a USB cable, wall adapter, pouch and manual.

After trudging back a floor, it was time to exchange the JR pass tickets. With my broken Japanese and their English, the whole exchange finished smoothly without a hitch. We were done in no time.

…hahah…

…hah…<sub>ha…</sub>

As slow as the start was, we were finally hitting our stride <sub>(and by stride, I mean completely the same pace as before, if not slower).</sub> The others needed an IC card (useful for painless public travel, vending machines or paying things in general). It was just 10m away from the JR pass exchange counter. If only I realised that sooner <sub>(it’s been a while so I can’t remember *everything*)</sub>. It’s a simple process done on an ATM-like machine and from memory, English was an option.

Near the finish line now! I only had to withdraw some money (since Japan is cash reliant for the most part). Surely, I couldn’t screw this up <sup>hah</sup>. With a Citibank card, it was advertised that any ATM would be accessible but I was refused from numerous machines :sweat_smile:. Even SMBC (what Citibank Japan branches have turned into) ATMs didn’t accept my card. That’s alright, I’ll just live off the couple hundred I had in hand <sub>:sob:</sub>. Eventually, I found a compatible ATM – it was a ‘Prestia’ branded SMBC ATM. In slid the card and out came a sigh of relief. I was now staring at this machine feeling quite nerved. I had read horror stories of being locked out of your account, even if you notified your bank. A lot of spending money was on this card... I punched in my PIN and amount needed.

_DENIED_

...

WHAT?! This could not be happening. Repeated tries still resulted in many denials. I tried one more time but this time I withdrew from another account type. Denied. Only one option left… the machine whirred for what felt like hours. Then, the divine glow as the gates of ~~heav~~Yen opened and presented me with glorious 10k bills. It was weird though, I was explicitly instructed to use *x* <sub>(forgot specifics)</sub> but ended up using *y*. For future transactions, I just used 7-Eleven ATMs and was hassle free (they have English options, too).

:clap: Okay! Truly finished now and it was high time we bounced. The plan was to leave at 19:30<sub>ish…</sub> we promptly left ~2 hours later… Not including transit time to our accommodation for the night <sub>(cue another hour)</sub>.

:fast_forward: to Emblem Hostel. This night was similar to my first night in Japan. It was late in the night, rain was drizzling down and we were a little lost. The receptionists were friendly and communicated superbly	. The hostel has glowing reviews but I was still surprised how nice the facilities were <sub>(hello, again my beloved Japanese toilets <3)</sub>. As nice as it was, it didn’t come without its faults to consider. The hostel is pretty far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo’s popular districts and if you’re travelling solely by JR, there aren’t any lines to benefit from. Although, the value for money is incredible and definitely outweighs the <sub>minor</sub> cons.

It was well past my dinnertime and despite having very little food in me, I was surprisingly getting on well. :raised_hands: Props to me. Prior to our departure, I made it my mission to find the nearest CoCo Ichibanya branch. It’s been too long and I needed my fix. Now this certain branch didn’t have a lot of information regarding its operating hours and whether its menu had the veg option (for our dear friend Carolyn). It was gonna be a 10min wet walk and I wasn’t particularly keen on arriving at a closed shop. After weaving through the empty side streets, the beautiful curry plate sign was visible far in the distance. My eyes lit up as bright as the sign and next thing you know, I was at the front door in a matter of seconds. Still open? Check. Had the veg menu? Cheeeck. The pains and sorrows of the day were washed away with spoonful after spoonful of that rich delicious curry. The pearly white rice (Japanese rice = best rice) bathing in an aromatic curry and topped with a crispy succulent tonkatsu was just divine. It was good to be back.

That concluded the main events of the day. We returned to knock out “early” to be ready for the new day and travels ahead. Falling asleep was a breeze if you compound no sleep 24hrs before and the comfort of a proper bed.

Thanks for reading and join me next time as we <a href="{{ baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-17-repe-repetition %}">embarked for Kyoto</a>.
