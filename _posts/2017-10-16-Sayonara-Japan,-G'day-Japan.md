Japan part 2 of ∞. What felt like a pipedream was now a reality. My friends and I were in talks about this trip for the longest time but we didn’t walk the walk. I kept prolonging anything from happening because I was waiting for cheap fares, but <a href="https://youtu.be/GsebMOWQiYM?t=29s">I was a fool</a>. It didn’t help that shifts were scarce, leaving funding for the trip waning as days went on. And maaaaaybe it didn’t help that I was spending so frivolously (still do to this day). BUT! Through the bleak clouds of doubt came a ray of sunshine called action.

It was an early September morning where I thought to myself, “what better way to start the season than to spring into action”. Now there weren’t any sales or promotions active at the time but I made the decision to book the flights anyway. That’s not to say I rashly came to that decision. I looked around for a good couple of minutes.やった! We walked the walk.
