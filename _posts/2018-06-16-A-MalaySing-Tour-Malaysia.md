With a day’s break from Taiwan, I soon found myself back on a flight to Malaysia. I can’t say that I was particularly keen heading into this toured trip. Especially from looking at the weather forecast, it was predicted to be heavy rain with a chance of thunderstorms (a.k.a misery and gloom). However, at no time at all during the trip did we feel the wrath of Zeus’ fury. In fact, it had rained more during my trip in Taiwan than it did here.

Glossing over this extra dreary procedure of air travel, we landed late into the evening where we “enjoyed” our dinner and stayed holed up in our measly hotel room. With concerns for our safety and wellbeing, we were advised to not venture out in the streets.

_Mmmm_ what a fantastic start to the trip.

The following morning, we were joyfully graced by the king‘s... palace‘s... front gate - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Palace/@3.1463559,101.6729486,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sIstana+Negara!3m4!1s0x31cc48582826c2ad:0xd36dbe78ef7caac8!8m2!3d3.1597054!4d101.6675566">Istana Negara, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Halim</a> (what a mouthful). The Malay Buckingham Palace held my attention for all of five minutes. Five minutes, because that's all we were there for. To admire a gate and get a squint at the palace at best.

:fast_forward: and we were at the front steps of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Batu+Caves/@3.2374599,101.6817347,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc470c8949a805:0xf2bfebb2b36f9ef9!8m2!3d3.2378844!4d101.6840385">Batu Caves</a>. Diverting our attention though was a quick sales pitch for some hair dye. Half of this Malaysia leg was filled with sales pitches... it sucked. I let this one off the hook though, because we were treated to the best milk tea I have ever had. It was a wee little cup but every minute sip was savoured until the very last drop. Absolutely divine.

With the liquid gold channelling inside me, I felt immense power coursing through my body. I was ready to take on the daunting steps that stood before me <sup><sup>jk, this shit was ezpz.</sup></sup>

As easy as it was, there is no denying that high humidity and glaring sunshine was the perfect recipe for sweaty discomfort. It also didn’t help that leg coverage was mandatory. Real shame that I couldn’t rock my miniskirt. The further I walked, the more I was greeted by some okay views of cliff-faces and cheeky lil monkeys.

With a decent lunch, we were back on the sales pitch tour. :fast_forward: a decent chunk and we’ve arrived at this up and coming shopping/resort megacity – <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/SkyAvenue/@3.4257357,101.7919973,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc140112192f9d:0xfbae36d84f7c263c!8m2!3d3.4257303!4d101.794186">Genting SkyAvenue</a> (or some string of words). Now, I say up and coming because a lot of it was still under construction (visited late Jan 2018).

What impressed me the most was its location, waaaay up in the mountains. Riding the cable cars through the thick fog, we were given a glimpse of what was in store for this lovely place.

</div>

Inside, you had four floors <sup><sup>I think</sup></sup> of broad walking space, <sup><sup>half</sup></sup> occupied by retailers, food stalls, restaurants, a cinema, casino, hotel and _more_. Beautifully wrapped in modernity, it doesn't get better than that for a shopping experience.

Although the options to shop and eat were aplenty, my attention had been taken by the “SkySymphony” show. To sum it up, it’s a stunning treat for the eyes and boy were they treated. The bright, suspended spheres moved with such smoothness and fluidity that I often forgot that it was all machinery. Photos and videos really don’t do them justice.

Attached to our _meh_ dinner was a _meh_ mood to match. A small downpour of rain, great for masking the tears and sweat :+1:. On the plus side, staff came to fetch us with giant parasols.

Still in the same locale as yesterday, we spent another night shut in our hotel. Just swell~

The following day, the pacing went from -1 to 10.5. There was a whole lot of Malaysia crammed into the day, starting with the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thean+Hou+Temple/@3.1218299,101.6854749,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc49f2773e27a9:0xdb9894ff096ce96c!8m2!3d3.1218299!4d101.6876636">Thean Hou Temple</a>. It wasn't anything special and we were done in a matter of minutes.

Quickly driving to the next destination, we were able to spend a little more time at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tugu+Negara/@3.1493527,101.6816063,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc49b57eea47b7:0x926f04df3868fecb!8m2!3d3.1493527!4d101.683795">Tugu Negara</a>. Though… it wasn’t particularly a location that needed to be dwelled upon. In saying that, I was able to enjoy a nice serving of durian ice-cream.

Next was a quick toilet stop at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Merdeka+Square/@3.1477582,101.6912348,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc49cd98881539:0x340bf906bc763359!8m2!3d3.1477582!4d101.6934235">Merdeka Square</a> before jetting off for the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Petronas+Twin+Tower,+Kuala+Lumpur+City+Centre,+50450+Kuala+Lumpur,+Federal+Territory+of+Kuala+Lumpur,+Malaysia/@3.1574509,101.709988,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cc37d6da4651e1:0x28dc542523e7a0bc!8m2!3d3.1577405!4d101.712167">Petronas Towers</a>. Admittedly, my preconception on the landmark was that it wasn’t anything special. Well, I was wrong about that. It was a fantastic building, inside and out. Comparing it to the Taipei 101, I found the Petronas Towers better. The fact that it is a dual design already made it a winner in my books. While the 101 is amazing with its glass structure, looking up at the metallic behemoth, that is the Petronas, was just jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Staring at the polished finish felt ethereal and don’t get me started on those stunning lines. Again, pictures just don’t do the landmark justice.

	<sup><em>*Not the Petronas Towers</em></sup>
</div>

As mentioned, today was packed to the rafters, so time spent here was short as the visits before it. However, I did manage to sneak in a quick visit inside and it was _noice_. Walking into the receptiony area, I was momentarily surprised by the Formula 1 décor. The connection of Petronas Towers and the F1 team never occurred to me <sup><sup>doh</sup></sup>. Past that, a fine underground<sup>?</sup> mall.

Hustling back on our coach, we headed over to a chocolatier that was boasted as super delicious by our tour guide. It wasn’t - _nheh_ at best. Despite that, I was running to every corner of the shop, scrounging up every sample I could get my hands on.

Before we even had a chance to settle, we were on the move again. This time to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Putra+Mosque/@2.9359529,101.6868962,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cdb61818046d5d:0x53f252ce4a40a088!8m2!3d2.9359529!4d101.6890849">Putra Mosque</a> with a small stop at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jambatan+Seri+Wawasan/@2.928029,101.6819893,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31cdb6387f0eefdf:0xed34c5bd184c5210!8m2!3d2.928029!4d101.684178">Jambatan Seri Wawasan</a> bridge. 
Being a religious site, there were certain rules about exposure and I was “lucky” enough to fall under that category. As my shorts were _too_ short and exposed much of my sexy thighs, I was required to robe up.

Though there wasn’t much to the place, the mosque was massive and had quite exquisite architecture and detailing.

Things _really_ started to wind down as the day went on, but not for the better. Leaving Kuala Lumpur for good, we spent the night in Malacca before heading over to Singapore the next day. For the remainder of the day we spent it wandering around the town and it was disappointing, to say the least. With what was scheduled for us, it was a whole lot of nothing.

It doesn’t stop there. Actually... it did. Our hotel was in the middle of nowhere, leaving us with nothing to do. On the plus side, the hotel was bitching. It was the only time I had a decent enough internet connection to be able to do anything. And the staying experience was top notch with features I wouldn't have ever expected.

With that, we reach the end of the Malaysian leg of the MalaySing Tour. If it wasn’t apparent, I didn’t particularly enjoy it as a whole. The food we ate, the sites we visited, it was just lacklustre and left a poor impression on me. But of course, that’s to be expected with your tours. 

Join me next time as we journey further south to Singapore, where my enjoyment goes up a few notches. Thanks for reading.
