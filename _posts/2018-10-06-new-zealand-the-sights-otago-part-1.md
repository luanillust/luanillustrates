Welcome to part one of New Zealand: The Sights - Otago, a continuation of my first venture into the great country that is New Zealand. Leaving Tekapo behind, we got the wheels rolling and started the long journey to our next township down in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wanaka,+New+Zealand/@-44.7163711,169.075331,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xa9d5461db9ec2d6f:0x500ef868479c1e0!8m2!3d-44.7031813!4d169.1320981">Wanaka</a>.

Reaching about halfway, we arrived at some ominous looking roads. Plastered with cautionary signs and abandoned remnants of vehicles, we entered <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lindis+Pass/@-44.5887408,169.6774151,15.28z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xa82aa1796ce94f3b:0x7b4a57d337c99253!8m2!3d-44.6!4d169.6666667">Lindis Pass</a> - a scenic drive nested in the border of Canterbury/Otago. Forced to take it slow due to treacherous conditions like icy roads (but not really because no chains required) and shitty drivers, I could understand why many would succumb to accidents. That and probably the fact people most likely averted their eyes from the road, completely enthralled by the magnificent sight presented before them.

From top to bottom, every mountain was enveloped by a blanket of stark white snow. It was absolutely breathtaking and I hardly ever say that. Feeling ill-equipped, we had to forego any ideas of climbing up the snowed over track heading up to the lookout. Not sticking around much longer, we couldn't do much but move on.
