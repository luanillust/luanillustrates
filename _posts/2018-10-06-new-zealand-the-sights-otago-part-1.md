Welcome to part one of New Zealand: The Sights - Otago, a continuation of my first venture into the gorgeous country. Leaving Tekapo behind, we got the wheels rolling and started the long journey to our next township down in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wanaka,+New+Zealand/@-44.7163711,169.075331,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xa9d5461db9ec2d6f:0x500ef868479c1e0!8m2!3d-44.7031813!4d169.1320981">Wanaka</a>.

	<em><sup>Need I remind you, it was the dead of winter</sup></em>
</div>

Reaching about halfway, we arrived at some ominous looking roads. Plastered with cautionary signs and abandoned remnants of vehicles, we entered <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lindis+Pass/@-44.5887408,169.6774151,15.28z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xa82aa1796ce94f3b:0x7b4a57d337c99253!8m2!3d-44.6!4d169.6666667">Lindis Pass</a> - a scenic drive nested in the border of Canterbury/Otago. Forced to take it slow due to treacherous conditions like icy roads and shitty drivers, I could understand why many would succumb to accidents. That and probably the fact people most likely averted their eyes from the road, completely enthralled by the magnificent sight presented before them.

<div class="imageset">

	<em><sup>I mean, how can you not?</sup></em>
</div>

From top to bottom, every mountain was enveloped by a blanket of stark white snow. It was absolutely breathtaking and I hardly ever say that. Feeling ill-equipped, we had to forego any ideas of climbing up the snowed over track heading up to the lookout. Not sticking around much longer, we couldn't do much but move on.

Once in the clear, it was smooth sailing until Wanaka. With scenic views more or less the same and roads emptier than my bank account, it could not have been a better drive.

Upon our arrival in Wanaka, we made a stop for a different type of sight - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Puzzling+World/@-44.6969882,169.1595093,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xa9d54f268575edf9:0xfa66441c199b7fcf!8m2!3d-44.696992!4d169.161698">Puzzling World</a>, an attraction with some puzzles, a lot of optical illusions and an outdoor maze. For NZ$22.50, we opted for the combo pass allowing us access to everything available. That was a mistake. Standalone pricing for the maze/illusions was NZ$18, clearly to rope in na√Øve people like me for the full package. The maze was a strong _meh_ and wasn't worth my time, money or thought. On that note, I found many of the illusions to be mediocre as well. However, the tilt room (illusions) alone was worth the price of admission. Unable to keep still and having a trippy sense of balance, I had an absolute blast.

As for the Wanaka township itself, it was like a bigger Tekapo with more sights, bites and delights. However, this expansion didn't come without its faults. With an increase in size came the influx of tourists making _my_ tourist experience that bit more irritable, especially in regards to parking spaces. Other than that minor gripe, everything else was gravy.

Back to our regular sights, we returned to the open road and just drove. Simply following the heart, we found ourselves at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Diamond+Lake/@-44.6421665,168.9601076,14.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xa9d54288ca94e74b:0x2a00ef86ab643820!8m2!3d-44.6477671!4d168.9639925">Diamond Lake</a>, and as an added bonus, there was a hike to see Lake Wanaka in all its glory.

The lake view was bust since it had frozen over with the worst lighting conditions possible. Views along the hike were sub-par with a lot of same same going on. Speaking of, the hike itself was no walk in the park. Gradation levels were intermediate and the amount of steps that had to be climbed... not fun. Like the Tasman Lake track, it was just mindless walking with a strong yearning for the finale. At some point, we were released from the cover of the trees and were exposed to the open air. That was when I knew the end was near. Clocking in another five or ten minutes of walking, we claimed the sweet fruits of labour.

Rejuvenated with the short break, we made the insufferable return to the car and by extension to Lake Wanaka for a botched night of astro.

The next day saw us return to the aimless driving. Due to my miserable attempt at visiting locations, I only yielded us an emptier tank of fuel and feelings of disappointment. Besides this mishap, the only notable occurrence was our visit to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roaring+Meg+9384,+New+Zealand/@-44.9810343,168.9707866,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xa9d52f6ce36ef947:0x500ef8684796480!8m2!3d-44.9722069!4d169.0541696">Roaring Meg</a>, a stream that powers a hydro-electric plant. Though there wasn't much to the place, its smashing sights and soothing sounds made Roaring Meg a nice stop to admire.

Like that, our first foray into the Otago region comes to a pause. While not as spectacular of an opener like Canterbury, I have very much enjoyed my time despite its shortcomings. Thank you for reading and join me next time for more New Zealand eye candy.
