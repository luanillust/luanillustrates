Welcome back to my _New Zealand: The Sights_ series. Finally given some leeway, the weather perked up enough for a jam packed day of sights and scenes. 

Throughout the journey thus far, water has been a recurring element at our locations and today was no different. Travelling up Haast Pass-Makarora Road, we were in for a treat with the many beautiful stops along the way.

Before that, we (of course) have to get our daily dosage of meagre sunrises.

Engrossed with a gratifying drive, I had to be weary not to miss our first destination: the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Pools+Walk/@-44.1641676,169.2745944,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6cd5674c70df2a35:0xc801d0fea1bbf729!8m2!3d-44.1641715!4d169.2767831">Blue Pools Walk</a>. Despite its signage, the locality's discrete vibe made it easy to be overlooked (especially given the speeds travelled). A simple trek through the lush green forest took us to the Makarora River and it was great. Being a short and level walk, minimal effort was required for a great visual payoff. :sob: _Why can't they all be like that_.

Continuing along the road, we stopped at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fantail+Falls/@-44.0782343,169.3839538,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6d2a9d66d45f8251:0xe2f833375706428b!8m2!3d-44.0782382!4d169.3861425">Fantail Falls</a>. Merely metres from the parking lot, this waterfall was the most accessible (though we went a roundabout way to get there). And while it was nice, I left feeling unsatisfied because the (surprisingly) deep stream of water blocked any chance of a nicer shot. Personal peeve aside, it's a quaint little sight that's pretty enough to make you not regret stopping by.

Not even long enough to finish one song, we had already arrived at the next destination and my favourite spot of the day - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thunder+Creek+Falls+Haast+Pass-Makarora+Rd,+Mt+Aspiring+National+Park+9382,+New+Zealand/@-44.0381075,169.3562584,15z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x6cd57d43b82e7fdb:0x432887a761d4ef16!2sThunder+Creek+Falls+Haast+Pass-Makarora+Rd,+Mt+Aspiring+National+Park+9382,+New+Zealand!3b1!8m2!3d-44.0381238!4d169.3650131!3m4!1s0x6cd57d43b82e7fdb:0x432887a761d4ef16!8m2!3d-44.0381238!4d169.3650131">Thunder Creek Falls</a>. Requiring a bit more effort than the last falls, we had to walk the odd couple hundred metres. Like before, it was a case of low input for a higher return :ok_hand:. As an added plus, no one bothered going further than the viewing platform, leaving me to my peaceful self at the thunderous waterfall.

Now able to jam through a handful of songs, we resumed our fun scenic drive by leaving the Makarora river scene and travelled along the adjoining Haast river. Here, we visited our first and last destination down this route - the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roaring+Billy+Falls/@-43.9373269,169.2890415,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6cd57ed4c6d76bd5:0x84b75e33634c7200!8m2!3d-43.9373308!4d169.2912302">Roaring Billy Falls</a>. Despite it requiring the most effort out of the three, the walk was still effortless with the usual forestry that we've encountered thus far.

Upon clearing the forest walk, the expected feelings of wonderment were replaced with a different sense of the sentiment. In our previous sights, there's always been a skewed perception of scale; we were either too far or on the same level to truly feel the scope of the size. Standing in the vast empty void between the walk and the mountains, I felt minuscule before the grandness of the towering behemoths. Adding to this, that empty void brought upon this serenity that the other places didn't. There was just beauty in the simplicity and it didn't matter if the falls sucked. They didn't... sort of. Like the Fantail Falls, they were too far to fully appreciate.

Earlier in the morning, we had glossed over some gorgeous New Zealand scenery due to the unfavourable photo conditions. On the returning leg, things started to look up. Like really up. I was finally given a chance at some gorgeously moody skies.

With the end of the day comes the end of this post. Thank you for reading and join me next time as I leave Wanaka and make my way down to Queenstown.
