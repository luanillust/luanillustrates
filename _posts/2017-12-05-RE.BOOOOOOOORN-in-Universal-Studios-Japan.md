>:musical_note: <a href="https://youtu.be/nWyhUoxAbYI?t=28s">“We are yooouung~, we are ooooone~”</a> :musical_note:

Today, we decided to mix it up a bit and arrived :sparkles: _fashionably_ late ✨. Turning the corner from the station, we were met with a fantastical <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/UNIVERSAL+CITYWALK+OSAKA/@34.6683662,135.4351358,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e8912d394faf:0x1308381aaad3ea60!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e896c92411e5:0xcb443fce0d6914b5!8m2!3d34.6683662!4d135.4373245?hl=en">Universal Citywalk (Osaka)</a>, a short strip home to great shops, tasty restaurants and fancy hotels. Disregarding all that, I made a beeline straight for the park entrance.

Having arrived as we did <sup><sup>:information_desk_person::sparkles:</sup></sup>, lines were surprisingly not that long with a wait time of ~10 min. Wait- we had our entry tickets, so why the line up? Welcoming our newest addition to the gang, the "Express Pass". At first, I was sceptical about the idea and wasn’t really on-board but that was incredibly <a href="https://youtu.be/kPONcsFfUzw?t=1m19s">dumb</a> of me. Though it didn’t save money (¥9700 :sob:), it saved a lot of time.

With a crevassed wallet, we walked through to be transported to <a href="https://youtu.be/-kl4hJ4j48s?t=1m10s">a whole new woooorld</a>. I was just in awe of how incredible the set designs were, easily making it my favourite part of USJ. I love the immaculate details that go into each world and the immersion that it brings. My words simply don’t do them justice and neither do my non-existent pictures <sup>(busy having fun)</sup>. However... my coverage of _The Wizarding World of Harry Potter<sup>TM</sup>_, on the other hand...

Passing the looming arch invited us into the magical world of Hogwarts, and I ~~became~~ felt like a wizard. With a <a href="https://youtu.be/SRcnnId15BA?t=39s">candy shop</a> just to our left, we started the tour around Hogsmeade.

It was here that I made a sole purchase within the entirety of USJ grounds. I lost ¥1200 for a chocolate frog that _didn't_ jump out of my grasp <sup>what a gip</sup>. What’s more, I got this dud of a holo card <sup>_what.a.gip_</sup>. As for the chocolate, it tasted okay and was _really_ big. Struggled to finish it.

Still getting over the fact I got swindled, I was offered some butterbeer in both <a href="https://youtu.be/kTHNpusq654?t=1m4s">hot and cold</a> renditions. It wasn't anything spectacular, just nice. The cold version didn't wow me with its basic soda composition. While the hot version did, with its sweet richness of butterscotch and warmth helping me bear the brunt of the cold.

_The Wizarding World of Harry Potter<sup>TM</sup>_ was just full of life with its establishments, one and a half rides, theatrical show, mini event interactions and Hogwarts Castle; to which we headed to next.

The main attraction at Hogwarts Castle is the 4D Forbidden Journey<sup>TM</sup> ride but it also held a self-guided tour, sneakily adjacent to the 4D ride. Inside the dimly lit hallways were few key visuals seen in the films. Though short, it was still fascinating to see how much could be implemented into the narrow spaces available.

As for the ride itself, that was a fantastic experience. Leaving our belongings in lockers half the size of what it should’ve been, we waited to be seated in the “Great Hall”. Once strapped in, I was instantly captivated. It was such an enjoyable ride; the interactions, the immersion and the thrills, it was just amazing.

Joyously leaving the castle, we were keen for the next ride – Flight of the Hippogriff<sup>TM</sup>. _Don’t do it_. Waiting in our seats lasted longer than the ride itself (barely a minute). As for the thrills and spills <sup>not</sup> to be had, it probably wouldn’t be enough to spill water from a teacup :unamused:.

If _The Wizarding World of Harry Potter<sup>TM</sup>_ taking up half of this post’s picture count didn’t give it away, I liked this world… a lot. Having brought a world that I could only dream about visiting to reality was nothing short of fantastic. Walking down the street with the familiar establishments made me giddy with joy. 

Having moved on from _The Wizarding World of Harry Potter<sup>TM</sup>_, we now had a large time gap until our next ride. This gave us time to visit the other spectacular worlds USJ had to offer :heart_eyes:. And as we travelled throughout the day, there would often be times where we got separated and were lost in the vast sea of park-goers. But like a lighthouse guiding the boats at bay, my sheep hat herded the gang together.

:fast_forward: and we’re hitting up all our rides. Being too absorbed in the moment and safety regulations existing, I didn’t capture much so expect walls of text :no_mouth:.

_The Amazing Adventures of Spide-Man: The Ride 4K3D_ <sup>(how it’s 4K is beyond me :confused:)</sup> was a fun but short experience. Harry Potter's experience ride was more thrilling and engaging.

Next were back-to-back (quite literally) rollercoaster rides on _Hollywood Dream – The Ride_ and its reverse _Backdrop_ variant to which we started with. 

The cool bois :sunglasses: were lucky enough to be seated at the very front <sub>(ultimately the back of the ride)</sub>, providing us with unadulterated views of the whole park at _sunset_. Magnificent :ok_hand:. Now strapped in, we were ever so slowly reeling back, taking in the gorgeous sights. Like the rising of the roller coaster, the butt-clenching sinking feeling was rising parallel to it :grimacing:; all the while blasting the ever so appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/nWyhUoxAbYI?t=28s">theme song</a>. Having been on the steep incline for a while now, I knew the drop was comi- WOO<sup>OO<sub>OO</sub>O<sup>OOO</sup>O<sub>OOO~</sub></sup> WAA<sup>aa<sub>AA</sub>A<sup>AAA</sup>aA<sub>AA~</sub></sup> It was so exhilarating being at the mercy of the ride, lifting and smacking me back down in the seat over the <a href="https://youtu.be/l5q-5VH4X-E?t=21s">many ups and downs</a>. Then unknowingly veering into the sudden lateral turns... Loads of fun.

So what was the normal _Hollywood Dream – The Ride_ like? It was fun. Having just come off the Backdrop, going forwards felt quite tame and lacked the thrill that the Backdrop had coursing through my veins. It was still enjoyable, especially with the USJ theme song booming.

Before entering the lines for _The Flying Dinosaur_, there was a signboard with an estimate of how long you should expect to wait. When we entered, it said 150+ mins... in the non-express line :weary:. Yeah yeah... express pass is good <sup>(:pray: my bad)</sup>.  This was going to be my <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Sushidai/@35.6636106,139.76748,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188bd93b4d9d59:0x52a0bcb03768b24f!8m2!3d35.6636063!4d139.7696687?hl=en">Sushidai</a> pt. II (Waited 7hrs for some <a href="https://youtu.be/I7iQKzsib4E?t=41s">soosh</a>). Having carried the heavy burden that was my backpack all day, it wrecked me in the long wait. Remember how my only meal so far had been a single chocolate frog, albeit a large one. That didn't help. Luckily, ma boi Alex saved my decrepit self with his stashed stacks of snacks. Back again with the hard carry :raised_hands:. 

Past the maze of a line on the ground floor, we finally reached the staircase taking us up to the ride where more lines awaited. Past that, we were finally awaiting our turn; it only took 1.5hrs so that’s a <sub>minor</sub> plus. With the wait over, I was now full of life, full of vigour.

It was only when the people prior to us boarding did I notice the ride’s special characteristic. Strapped in their seats, they awaited the <a href="https://youtu.be/eEfvbh-KDaM?t=53s">greenlight</a>. But as they were about to set off, they were lifted in a way that they were now suspended on the rail and facing down at the floor. 

:smiley:

<sup>Oh<sub>hOh0</sub>hoOoO<sub>OhOhO~</sub></sup> this was going to be good. Off they jetted with shrieks and screams, paving the way for us to board. Strapped and secured, I awaited to <a href="https://youtu.be/KnFYJUydN7A?t=22s">get lifted</a>.

Rocking forward, the ride set off zooming into the night, barrelling through the skies, looping through loops and feeling like a _flying dinosaur_. It was just a crazy good time. And crazily enough, throughout the ride, I didn’t feel that butt-clenching sink :open_mouth:. It truly was fun through and through.

Hands down, this was my favourite ride of the day and that excruciatingly long wait was all <a href="https://youtu.be/XfUAWp4JUxA?t=1m27s">worth it</a>. Even writing this out has my heart going again :astonished:.

High on adrenaline, we rushed to _Jurassic Park – The Ride<sup>®</sup>_ and _JAWS<sup>®</sup>_ respectively. Late as it was, lines were as short as my patience and packed crowds reduced to not-so-packed crowds.

Starting with _Jurassic Park – The Ride<sup>®</sup>_, I found it to be a nice time. Nothing super-duper exhilarating but that was fine, since it’s more of a relaxing ride through kind of experience. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs weren't real but that didn’t detract from how amazing they were. The set pieces were just a marvel to look at.

<div class="imageset">
	<img src="{{ baseurl }}/assets/luantics/P008/52.jpg" alt="ending snap of Jurassic Park the Ride"/>
</div>

Bolting over to _JAWS<sup>®</sup>_, we kicked back to enjoy the ride. It was more of a romantic boat cruise than the typical thrill ride. An infatuated shark <sup>(again, not real)</sup> following you around? Doesn't get more _romantic_ :cupid:. At the front of the boat was our host with a performance deserving of an Oscar. Whether we were the last few groups or well into the night, it didn’t matter; she was committed and gave it her all. Her endearing enthusiasm made the ride so much more enjoyable.

Wondering what to do next, Wilson insisted on _Backdraft_ as it looked “reeeaaally cool”. Starting off well with a small crowd, we were ushered in quite quickly to the waiting area. Where we waited for at least 20mins... ummm what could be taking so long? The more we waited the more digs we made at Wilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/Bl_yKUZ7QNU?t=2m13s">This better be worth it</a>.

Doors opened and we proceeded to this viewing gallery type of stage. Okay... lights dimmed and a doco is projected onto the walls. “ロン ハワード です”.

:neutral_face:

It was Ron Howard, the director behind the film on which this experience is based on. The dubbed video played for a couple of minutes and we trudged into the next room where a small set piece embodied the stage. Another video played and we’re just laughing to ourselves at what we got ourselves into. What _Wilson_ got us into.

Entering the third stage, we were far gone from expecting anything so Vivian packed away her camera and I jested that she’d regret doing that. I mean, how could you ignore all this _action_?! Who knew that I was onto something :sweat_smile:.

In the last stage, things started to heat up, literally. Once the video finished, :fire:<a href="https://youtu.be/ALj5MKjy2BU?t=1m">fire</a>:fire: bursts out from barrels. Flames engulfed the stage props and everything was just igniting. Realising that this was the climax, Vivian pulled out her camera ready to roll, but of course it finished as soon as it started :joy:. With the fire show over, I thought that was the end of it. Nooo no no. It went above and beyond that (again, quite literally). Hearing a creak overhead, the catwalk “collapsed” on us as the platform beneath us shook.

I was wrong. _The Flying Dinosaur_ wasn't the best, this was. Those few seconds of exhilaration cemented my thoughts on the experience. Best. Ride. _Ever_. 

Backdraft is by no means something you would want to experience but we did enjoy the absurdity of it all. And of course, ridiculing Wilson.

Leaving with high spirits, we stumbled into the final moments of the Xmas show. The visuals and music were just gorgeous, even with my obstructed view.

With the park closing up soon, we had time for one last ride - _Shrek’s 4-D Adventure<sup>TM</sup>_. Just like _Backdraft_, the wait in line wasn’t long, but the wait to get in was. The experience was okay. Hearing the Japanese cast of Shrek was amusing. At this point, I was quite exhausted and nodded off many times throughout the film. Regardless, it was never going to top Backdraft.

Upon exiting USJ, we returned to the Universal Citywalk to wolf down a much-needed meal. The night's menu was found at one of my favourite fast food joints, MOS Burger. A native Japanese burger chain rival to the likes of Freshness Burger, Lotteria and Maccas.

With our hunger satiated and exhausted out of our minds, we plonked ourselves on the train, eager to return home. USJ is undeniably one of my best highlights of the trip. It’s incredibly fun and just a beautiful place to visit. I cannot wait for the day I revisit and relive it. Thanks for reading and join me next time as Carolyn and I travel to Himeji :kissing_heart:.
