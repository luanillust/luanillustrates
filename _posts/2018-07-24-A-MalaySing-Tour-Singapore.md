Singapore was leaps and bounds more fun than the Malaysia leg. However, it still lacked a lot to make it a _good_ trip. Time allocation was a huge factor and the food was subpar, as per usual for tours. Still, I enjoyed the little taste test that was this trip... somewhat.

Having cleared customs, we jumped straight into tourist activities, with the first stop being the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jurong+Bird+Park/@1.3187065,103.704253,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da055d47e25239:0x8a03a32b70be1d4c!8m2!3d1.3187065!4d103.7064417">Jurong Bird Park</a>. With great commitment to avian conservation, it's a neat place to visit... if you're into that. For me, the bird zoo isn't really worth the time, even with its amusing bird show.

:fast_forward: to the evening and we've headed out for a night in the town; kicking off with a gorgeous boat cruise. This was probably my favourite moment from the trip. It wasn't anything special or unique per se, but it did feel unworldly. Seeing the skylines lit up by the city lights, it appeared to me as if I was looking at a high resolution display. That greater than reality level of HD crispness. And having come back to see it during the day, the difference really is... night and day.

Continuing the night's festivities, we were able to catch the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Spectra+Water+Show/@1.2842137,103.856044,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1905d8aef813:0x13faa6499ee2162f!8m2!3d1.2842083!4d103.8582327">Spectra Water Show</a>. Bedazzling lights and bass thumping goodness, it was hard not to be amazed by the incredible technicalities. Closing off the first night, we dipped our foot in Singapore's incredible retail scene.

Kicking off the next day, we revisited last night's locales and completely skipped over some of the places I thought we were visiting - disappointing to say the least.

Shifting things into gear a little, we visited the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gardens+by+the+Bay/@1.2815683,103.8614245,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1904937e1633:0x62099677b59fca76!8m2!3d1.2815683!4d103.8636132">Gardens by the Bay</a>. Time spent here was kept at the bare minimum but we could've definitely afford to stay for longer. The place is absolutely massive with its fair share of beautiful sights and scenes. However, some of those sights are behind paywalls (conservatories).

</div>

After the garden, we were taken for a long drive around these pretty cool spots. Initially, I thought we were getting off to see them out of the coach, so I didn't snap away. Boy was I wrong. We stayed in the bus the _whole_ time until we reached our next destination <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sentosa/@1.2489856,103.8188008,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1eac78128345:0xf8f637555d901d01!8m2!3d1.2494041!4d103.8303209">Sentosa</a> - an island off the coast, full of fun activities and sights.

Fist up, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marine+Life+Park/@1.258332,103.817718,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1bfe7e7b1891:0xf808a170763b1279!8m2!3d1.2587386!4d103.8186452">Marine Life Park</a>. While the critters are awesome, the facility was not. There wasn't really any structure or order that made my viewing experience flow well. Areas would fork into areas that don't connect or continue seamlessly. Having been to the Kaiyukan in Osaka, I was quite dissatisfied with this aquarium.

With all that's available at Sentosa (golf course, luge track, Universal Studios, waterpark, trick museum etc.), we were lucky enough to go up the mildest version of the Megadrop. That and a lesser (and annoying) version of the water lights show from the night before. _Fun_.

In the morning of our final day, we were taken to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Singapore+Botanic+Gardens/@1.3138451,103.8137249,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1a1c7ddb60bd:0xeadf14903ad3d980!8m2!3d1.3138397!4d103.8159136">Singapore Botanical Gardens</a>. While it is a massive place, we spent all of our time at the National Orchid Garden. Behind a small fee, the immaculate space is quite a lovely sight with a surprising amount of  varied orchid types.

Closing the trip in <sup>Singa</sup>poor form, we were left to ourselves at a department store for too many hours (needed a couple at most). It could've been spent at the garden but what do I knoooow... Twiddling our thumbs 'til the very end, the subpar trip left no real impressions. As a slight positive, it was quite interesting to see Terminal 4, the latest and greatest in Changi Airport. Keeping me curious with its massive size and modern design, Changi is by far the best airport I've ever seen. What's more, I was able to not hate the airport process thanks to one small (free) arcade machine. Unfortunately, I don't have pictures. Too busy playing maybe...

Whew~ that was a long one. Thank you for reading and sticking through to the end. I'll see you in the next chapter of Luantics. Spoiler alert: it's New Zealaaaaand. WOOO~
