It was another slow start to the day :expressionless:. Today was full of trips to Kyoto’s hottest attractions. First was Kiyomizu-dera - a temple up in the hills of Eastern Kyoto. As an early bird, I like the fact that it opens at 6:00 but as we had those that treasure sleep, we didn’t make it out the door until much later.
