Welcome back to "New Zealand: The Sights" part two. Simply craving more of Mount Cook, we returned to the beautiful mountain for another round of sights and soreness. Now, you'd think that after yesterday's gruelling long hike, I'd be dissuaded for another journey; especially given how my body was starting to feel the aftermath. My willingness to fight through the pain is testament to the beauty of the place. Before that, we have another attempt of me catching sunrise down by the Church of the Good Shepherd with unsatisfied results.

Turning off Mount Cook Road and onto the Tasman Valley Road, we were en route for another day full of life's beautiful pleasures. From the car park, the walk to the Tasman Lake lookout is tedious with a 180 on the difficulty. Starting out flat, the track slowly ramps up the incline until you're hit with a set of steps (what perfect timing to take this hike). Even though the length of the Hooker Valley track was extensive, you had the sights to keep your mind off the walk. With this track, there wasn't much to look at. As a result, I ended up focusing on walking and how much of a pain the steps were on my legs. New Zealand: leg day everyday. 

Hitting a slight fork in the steps, I caught a glimpse of the "blue" lakes. Not wanting to lose momentum, I marched on to the top. What came next was a mixture of feelings. Washing away my negativity, I was amazed by the Tasman Glacier Lake. The vast body of water accompanied by the monolithic mountains just had me mesmerised. However, the fleeting moment didn't last. I quickly grew bored of the view and the cold gusts of wind helped me

There were three lakes in line, but people stopped at the first one. It irked me. Did people not see _three_ lakes going up to the viewpoint?
