Yaaaay~ A non-late start…ish, ahem... _Carolyn_ :unamused:. With my _Shimano Tokyo 23_ backpacked to the brim with my _Fujifilm X-T1, Fujfilm instax mini 8, Sirui T-025X, LEE Filters, BlackRapid Sport and SanDisk Extreme Pros_ <sup>(sponsor me<sup>ee<sup>eee</sup></sup>)</sup>, my shoulders and back were going to have a field day. _Yay…_

Catching the train out to Himeji took <a href="https://youtu.be/3UGMDJ9kZCA?t=2m4s">1h20m</a>, so it was a good time to catch some Zs. Because who wants to soak in beautiful scenery, amirite? :fast_forward: :sleeping:

Upon stepping out of the station, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Himeji+Castle/@34.839449,134.691716,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3554e003a23324b3:0x7a4f8c2f6eba81b1!8m2!3d34.839449!4d134.6939047?hl=en">Himeji Castle</a> was well within view even at its long distance away. Walking down the long straight lasted about 15mins and was the usual city scene, nothing special of note. It was only when we reach the castle grounds, that Carolyn realised she had forgotten her camera :joy:. _Ohhhh noooo… what a shame_ :smirk:. Under my watch, not a minute passed without her being reminded of the blunder.

We paid for a combo entry ticket, allowing us access into the castle and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Koko-en/@34.839449,134.691716,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3554e003a23324b3:0x7a4f8c2f6eba81b1!2sHimeji+Castle!8m2!3d34.839449!4d134.6939047!3m4!1s0x3554e01b1dfd140f:0xf17fb607cf8ff4b7!8m2!3d34.8379439!4d134.6897542?hl=en">Koko-En</a>, a beautiful neighbouring garden. Admission was ¥1040 and unlike Osaka castle, it was worth it...<sup>?</sup>

While I regard Osaka’s castle exterior as beautiful with its gold and green trim, I found Himeji’s castle to be _more_ beautiful and elegant with its monotonous palette and grander structure. Interior wise, it was well preserved and maintained. It was amazing seeing the various hidden hiding spots and tactically being able to see the entire castle grounds from above.

When entering the castle itself, you’re required to swap your shoes for some slippers and traverse with your bagged shoes in hand. From the ground floor, we made our way up and down in a spiral, much like how the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan was.

Finished with the castle structure, we aimlessly wandered its grounds now with some ice cream in hand. I cannot recall what they were called or branded as but they were quite good. Throughout the whole day, I would often burp up the soda-flavoured ice cream; it was fantastic.

Leaving the way we came in, it was a 500m walk towards the right for Koko-En. Stepping into the garden was like stepping into tranquillity materialised. Even with the handful of others there, the beautiful scenes could be enjoyed in peace. If only I could have _all_ the nice spots to myself :innocent:.

Past the water featured main<sup>?</sup> garden, there were, surprisingly, a large number of smaller gardens. They weren’t as nice as the main one, but still gorgeous nonetheless.

The day was almost over and we had only explored what was only the tip of Himeji’s iceberg. Heading back into town, these two knuckleheads went for lunch... at 16:00. Not before picking up some more ice cream.

We were just heading back to the station when a giant picture of a salad bowl caught my eye, perfect for Carolyn. This vegan friendly place was called <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/THE+FARMER%E2%80%99S+DAUGHTER/@34.8314864,134.6897166,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x3554e00e3e93e7d3:0x4dcab12a58ed1ecb!4m5!3m4!1s0x3554e00e3d179c3b:0x3e1dd67c07057f22!8m2!3d34.831482!4d134.6919053?hl=en">The Farmer’s Daughter (café and kitchen)</a>. From the outside, it looked like a standalone restaurant, but the establishment shares the space within the department store. The staff were just lovely and sweet (not to mention cute :heart_eyes:).

As for the food, it was good. From memory, their menu was entirely western. I ordered a pasta dish that was pretty tasty. And Carolyn’s salad bowl looked nice… enough.

Just as we were about to head home, we were distracted by <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/piole+HIMEJI/@34.8272743,134.688845,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x3554e06d326ff885:0xa230d50ac0031720!4m5!3m4!1s0x3554e06d32769895:0xf0074a240e667c0a!8m2!3d34.8272699!4d134.6910337?hl=en">piole Himeji</a>, yet another of the many department stores across Japan. Here, I was introduced to the worst best thing I could have come across - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bsidelabel5892/">B-Side Label stickers</a>. With a price tag of ±¥300, you can see why. It was just love at first sight, seeing the humorous, cute, cool or visually stunning designs. It was an inevitable purchase. I’m an absolute sucker for these kinds of things :sweat_smile:.

Below are the few stickers I amassed on the trip. Looove loove love the "Japan" and "Departures" stickers :heart_eyes:.

Unfortunately <sup>or fortunately</sup>, I came to learn about its standalone stores after returning to Australia. Imagine the oodles of money I would have lost...

Eventually, we left that department store to return to Osaka and regroup with our friends. For an outing at yet another department store... :joy:.

As the night came to an end, so did our Osaka leg. Tomorrow, we go further south to Hiroshima for a couple of days. Thank you for reading and join me next time.
