:sleeping: This early bird could not get the worm. Today, we hit up Kyoto’s hottest "K" attractions - Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji and Kurama. KK- :no_mouth:

First was <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kiyomizu-dera/@34.9948561,135.7850463,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x62af658650c434ba!8m2!3d34.9948561!4d135.7850463">Kiyomizu-dera</a>, a temple up in the hills of Eastern Kyoto. Had this early bird gotten his way, we would have been there when it opens at 6:00 to catch some nice morning light. Not only that, but also to have time to visit many other landmarks like <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Rengeoin+Sanjusangendo/@34.9878845,135.7717126,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xaa2b01ebdb651688">Sanjusangendo</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kitano+Tenman-g%C5%AB+Shrine/@35.0314012,135.7351215,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5b26fec16c2eee1a">Kitano Tenmangu Shrine</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E6%9D%B1%E6%9C%AC%E9%A1%98%E5%AF%BA/@35.0268811,135.7366504,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1shonganji+temple!3m4!1s0x600108a5b2ff6191:0x2def9c35f2f6c95a!8m2!3d34.9910052!4d135.7584791">Honganji</a> <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Nishihongan-ji+Temple/@34.9910052,135.7562904,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1shonganji+temple!3m4!1s0x600108a5a9aa64a9:0xb5b071768d688b56!8m2!3d34.9914842!4d135.7517349">Temples</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kyoto+Imperial+Palace/@35.0314012,135.7351215,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x600108652e05500d:0xaaaf9eec1f34bbf5!8m2!3d35.0254135!4d135.7621246">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a>...

A fair amount of Kyoto’s attractions aren’t accessible by trains and are often reached by bus, and unlike a certain service back in Adelaide, I love it. The best thing about it is the signage. Down the front is a display notifying the upcoming stops with Romanised names and stop numbers for easier comprehension. Adding to that, there are announcements in both Japanese and English. What’s cool is that the fare is based on distance travelled <sup>(citation needed)</sup> and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg <sub>(looking at you again, bAdelaide Metro).</sub> In some places, however, buses have flat rates, making things even more convenient. Though we were using our IC cards, there are day passes available which have fantastic value for the frequent travellers.

Reaching Kiyomizu-dera required a steep walk to the top. And as per usual, I packed just about everything into my backpack, so you can imagine the _wonders_ it did for my shoulders and back. After the morning exercise, we reached the forefront where a large gate and shrine were stationed. Moving onto the main hall required a small ¥400 admission.

As a slight mist of rain started to fall, the temple grounds looked like a mystical fantasy. Despite that, I was quite underwhelmed by the attraction. From the pictures, I thought it’d be bigger and grander than what I was seeing. It’s an impressive structure, sure, but I just wasn’t feeling it. Yet, the area encompassing the temple was surprisingly big, with forked paths routing down and around the hills.

From there, we proceeded to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kinkaku-ji/@35.03937,135.7270544,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6001a820c0eb46bd:0xee4272b1c22645f!8m2!3d35.03937!4d135.7292431?hl=en">Kinkaku-ji</a>, a temple <sub>~~of _SOLID GOLD_~~</sub> wrapped in gold foil. We forewent <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Higashiyama+Jisho-ji/@35.0270213,135.7960171,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600109050b426fe1:0x258aca1ce888abc9!8m2!3d35.0270213!4d135.7982058?hl=en">Ginkaku-ji</a>, the silver <sub>(but not)</sub> variant, because of the aforementioned time constraints. Not to mention, it pales in comparison to its _golden_ sibling. Unlike Kiyomizu-dera, the ¥400 admission was required from the get go, with all its viewable landmarks behind the pay wall.

From start to finish, it’s a linear path with, frankly, not much to view. The temple sat atop a bank of water, with that picturesque view some distance away.

</div>

Moving around the bank got you closer to the temple to admire its golden glory.

	</div>
</div>

Moving past the golden temple brings you to a garden area complete with another small temple. As interesting as it all was, there really isn’t much to it and I breezed through quite quickly.

</div>

From here on, it was the first of the (many) series of unfortunate Luan-doings :disappointed:. Finished with Kinkaku-ji, we headed over to the sole train station that would take us to <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3933.html">Kurama</a>, a lush rural spot just outside the city.

It was a mess, I was a mess. Due to my indecisiveness and blind trust in Google Maps, it was a ruthless cycle of hopping on and off this or that bus, waiting for buses we weren’t going to catch and walking the extra unnecessary mile… (*￣∀￣)

After that long debacle, we finally made it to the small station that was Demachi-yanagi. Interestingly, it seemed to me that the trains were automated (no conductor/controller) and the carriage had a unique seating arrangement. The large windows offered scenic views throughout the journey. It was beautiful seeing the back of my eyelids <sub>:sleeping:</sub>.

</div>

Upon stepping off, I noticed a veil of rain shimmering down - or so I thought. As it turned out, it was actually snow! It was only a light sprinkle and lasted seconds at best but it casted a gorgeous layer of exquisiteness on the already beautiful scenery (none of which I captured).

Time was closing in on 16:00 and you know we hadn’t eaten :speak_no_evil:. Needing to satiate our hunger, we wandered the desolate streets and empty stores to find _the_ meal to have. I had mistakenly walked into this udon shop where our conversation led me to believe they were open. They weren't. Not fretting though, as we found a cosy little restaurant <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E5%92%8C%E3%81%BF%E5%AE%B6+%E5%BF%83%E5%A4%A9%E7%8B%97/@35.1135599,135.7732895,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6001a66baa9063df:0x12807995badb2c52!8m2!3d35.1136085!4d135.7734666?hl=en">(和み家 心天狗)</a> not too far down the street _aaand_ they could cater for Carolyn. 

As if having the warmth of a tatami room to ourselves wasn't relaxing enough, the staff were very kind to make us all the more comfortable.

</div>

The menu wasn’t painstakingly big but there was still a wide range of choice. The food was prepared quickly and devoured even quicker. The aforementioned food was delicious, filling and easy on the wallet. After finishing our meal, we chilled – undisturbed – whilst forever sipping on our "durry" tea.

Having rested, we journeyed off for the long hike into the neighbouring town of <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3967.html">Kibune</a>. Or more aptly, planned to journey off. It completely slipped my mind that closing times existed... sooo... no hike, no ropeway, and no neighbouring town. All those hoops, all that travelling… all the way out here… for some lunch. :information_desk_person: <sup>Welcome<sup> to</sup><sup><sup> Luantics</sup></sup></sup>

Glumly heading back to Kyoto, we lifted our spirits with an evening of shopping.

I wasn't particularly desperate for dinner thanks to the late lunch, but Carolyn was feeling a bit peckish. Leading us to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/mumokuteki+cafe%26foods+Kyoto/@35.006557,135.7642833,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600108835873ae29:0x4545194c795cc8a8!8m2!3d35.006557!4d135.766472?hl=en">mumokuteki café&foods</a>, a vegan restaurant that doubled as a goods store on the floor below. The seating space was no bigger than my backyard and thus was quite packed. Relegating us to the waiting area that exposed us to their backyard - the freezing alleyway entrance. Not for long though, as we were fast-tracked to the top, thanks to the no shows :raised_hands:.

The menu was limited to whatever the sets were or whatever was on the signboard. They weren't exactly speedy with their orders and by the time they did come out, I ended up being in the mood for a bite anyway. Surprisingly, the sets were well populated with food and tasted quite good. Especially the tofu cheesecake, that tasted _really_ good. All in all, it was a pleasing place with decent prices, tasty food and was just filled with attractive patrons ಠ‿ಠ.

Back at the bnb, we spent the night packing as it marked the end of the Kyoto leg. It's been a fantastic start to the trip, easily making it my favourite city. As much as I love the hectic hustle and bustle of Tokyo, I love the scenery and peacefulness of Kyoto more. Kinda reminds me of Adelaide in that sense, but a thousand times better. Thanks for reading and join me next time as we venture into the neighbouring city of Osaka.
