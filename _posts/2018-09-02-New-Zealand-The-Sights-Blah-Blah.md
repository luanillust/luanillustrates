Travelling from location to location was a breeze with ease thanks to the rental car and yours truly as the <a href="https://youtu.be/93HdxDoZcVk?t=1m19s">_best_ driver</a>. Having never rented a car, I was greener than the grass on the other side. Not wanting some weaksauce Yaris or Mazda 2, it was tough looking for a nice car without breaking the bank. After hours of research and price comparisons, I was led to Apex Car Rentals and my choice of the Ford Focus. Though, I still paid a pretty penny without the early bird pricing. 

Despite the delay in our flight, I was still keen as a bean to be zipping around the New Zealand roads in the hot hatch. By the time we reached the Airpark, it was quite late and I was (admittedly) feeling not _as_ super. Stepping inside the office, I was given my paperwork and... Toy..ota key fob?? After many double takes, the fact that we had been upgraded a couple classes kicked in. We were going to be cruising around in a Toyota RAV4 G-X-L (no basic bitch miles for this boiiii). Having said that, I wasn't entirely on-board with this upgrade. I mean I _really_ wanted to be <s>hooning</s> driving safely _and_ appropriately in the Focus. However, I did appreciate the Toyota RAV4 GXL's AWD, smart entry, spaciousness, _sport mode_ and overall ruggedness when taken off-road. Not so appreciated... the thirstiness. Thirstier than the comments on an insta model picture, this thing ate through petrol like a hungry hungry hippo on 'roids - especially on sport mode. For the few seconds I was utilising it, I clearly saw the fuel gauge diminishing (like my bank account). With that said, I wouldn't have to worry about its thirstiness if petrol wasn't so _damn_ expensive. Starting with a minimum of NZ$2.24/L and going as high as NZ$2.37/L for _regular 91_, you can see why I am unenthused about the mileage. My only other gripe is that the infotainment system was garbage. Options to mess around with were limiting and I wasn't able to enjoy all of my USB plugged music. Constantly on 1112 songs, I was never able to get the full six thousand+. Even after adding/removing tracks, it was still stuck with the same counter. Bollocks.

Unable to grab the SIM I wanted in the airport, our journey was slightly pushed back. Of course there are providers there, but they're all bullshit. With sham offerings from Vodafone and Spark, you can get _"big"_ data _"lover"_ packs containing 4GBs of data and costly calls & texts for ~NZ$40. Get. _Lost_. Even 2degrees (the carrier I went with) was guilty of this but at least they offered something more substantial - 10GB  data and "unlimited" calls & texts for NZ$49 or NZ$50 for 15GB of straight data. And what's with Telstra charging AU$10 a day for 200 _measly_ megabytes of data. _Megabytes_. Who in their right mind would ever think that's a good idea.

It was the crack of dawn and I was now tasked with obtaining a SIM instead of setting off for adventure. With this, I was able to at least see more of Christchurch. And by more, I mean Hornby's Countdown and The Hub Hornby :+1:.

Other aids in my journey included: the <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/">Dept. of Conservation NZ</a>, great for everything and anything nature; the <a href="https://www.metservice.com/national/home">MetService</a> for all weather needs, though BOM is still top dog; <a href="https://www.aa.co.nz/travel/roadwatch/">AA Traveller</a> for traffic and road reports, among many other things; and my GPS unit for keeping me _on_ the roads.

One last thing. I am glad New Zealand's driving laws are the same as Australia's and that I don't have to go through the headache of driving on the _wrong_ side of the road.

Having travelled enough off the beaten track, <a href="/luantics/New-Zealand-The-Sights-Canterbury-part-1">let's return to the main story</a>.
