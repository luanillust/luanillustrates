<sup><sup><sup>zzzt</sup></sup><sup>zzzt</sup>zzzt~</sup> Underenath the pillow rang a suffocated alarm waking me up. Everything had to be discrete. It was five in the morning after all and we had to keep our stranger roomie undisturbed from…us <sub>(ultimately, only Carolyn).</sub> Carolyn and I had to channel our inner ninja and get out quickly and quietly. All of which Carolyn failed to do :unamused:<sub><sub>jk~</sub></sub>.

Once down in reception, we regrouped with the others and set off on our journey to the South – to Tokyo station.  

With our _beloved_ luggage in our clutches, we travelled around town without the aid of escalators _or_ elevators <sub>ngooh</sub>. While my well-oiled machine-like arms could handle the luggage, it was annoying going up and down multiple flights of stairs. I moan about how it was annoying when my luggage was still light... by the end of the trip... :sweat_smile:

Not much later, we arrived at a desolate Tokyo station. Desolate for all of five minutes. Crowds of people were coming in droves before you knew it.

With shinkansen tickets booked, it was a chance to pick up a meal. A shinkansen trip wouldn’t be complete without a bento box. Surprisingly, I haven’t experienced the joy of consuming one, so when I was shopping, I was in awe at the amount of choice available. It was just shelves upon shelves and stacks upon stacks. In the end, I got what reflected myself. <sub>A mirror hahaaa...</sub> It was a novelty shinkansen shaped box. Also fitting for the group’s first shinkansen trip.

</div>

Needlessly dawdling around left us rushing to our platform. It was unbelievable how close we nearly missed the train. As soon as the last foot made the slightest contact, the doors slid shut. Well... Maybe not _as_ dramatic but we were cutting it close for sure.

It took some time to settle in our seats since we boarded the wrong carriage. On and on, we trudged along until we reached our destination - the end carriage. As I sat my little caboose, I was ready to devour my little bento. Despite its small size, there was enough to satiate my hunger.

In the 2hrs 44mins of blissful transit, we chatted, we slept and we trawled through the internet for that catchy arrival theme (to no avail). Time just breezed by and we were at Kyoto faster than you could say, "a-". 

<sub>P.S. JR, stop excluding Nozomi and Mizuho trains. I would like to experience faster travel with the pass too :grin:.</sub>

The bnb was a short walk away from the station (like really short), but we only came to that conclusion after an unnecessarily long search :sweat_smile:. Bloody Google Maps was showing me complete baloney directions. Out of the blue, a kind old man must have seen bright neon “WE NEED HELP” signs floating above our heads for he chimed in to help us. And while it was super sweet, I couldn’t help but feel bad because he couldn’t help much and I didn’t want to take any more of his time. Bless his kind soul :innocent:. 

After circling the block many times, we found the kind of hidden entrance to the apartment complex. Straight down the road from exiting the station... <sub><sub>_LUANtics_, amirite.</sub></sub>

After taking the cramped elevator up a few floors, we were greeted by _two_ flights of stairs <sub>ngooh</sub>. But wait! There's more! I wasn’t able to unlock the padlock safe holding the key. Surely I was punching in the right numbers. The others even tried themselves. As I was about to email our host about the predicament, I found out that they changed the passcode... written right there in an email I thought was non-pertinent… :grimacing:. That’s a lesson to remember <sub>(one I’ll probably repeat).</sub>

The apartment was nice. We were <a href="https://youtu.be/GEFaYkW13UY?t=29s">on the top floor</a>, which sported a nice rooftop view. Decked with a heated floor, a heated toilet and fancy heating temperature controls – it was just heaven. 

During R&R, I took my brand new set of LEE filters and majorly discounted lens to tinker with out on the roof. Never have I ever been as precautious with my gear as I did that moment, because what could only be described as gale force winds were running amok. Even the most stable of tripods would shake with the G’s being belted out up there. As I was carrying only everything I could in my backpack, it served as a great counterweight as it did a storage device (still didn’t quell my worry). Despite the cold windy hell, I was pleased with my picture and new FUJIFILM lens / LEE filters <sub>(sponsor me).</sub>

After a “short” break, it was a good time as any to leave for <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Togetsuky%C5%8D+Bridge,+Kyoto,+Kyoto+Prefecture%EF%BC%88%E6%B8%A1%E6%9C%88%E6%A9%8B%EF%BC%89/@35.0128532,135.6755677,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600107551467b1b7:0xa075621dab714243!8m2!3d35.0128532!4d135.6777564">Togetsukyo</a>, a bridge in Arashiyama that spans across the Katsura River. Aaaaand it was nothing suuuper special to visit. Perhaps it required a festive season to bring out that tourist attraction oomph~ but yeah, quite lacklustre.

Crossing it led us into the bustling district with its variety of tourist establishments. While the streets weren’t jam packed with tourists, there was a sense of peace walking down the traditional yet modern neighbourhood. Along the streets, you can find enticing food stalls, alluring but pricey souvenir shops, and the like.

In the midst of touristing, we stumbled into an entryway for the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Arashiyama+bamboo+forest/@35.0128528,135.6690016,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sbamboo+grove!3m4!1s0x0:0x1f81d8747bb510c4!8m2!3d35.0170414!4d135.6718746">Bamboo Grove</a>. Like, it wasn't an official entryway or anything. It was just down an alleyway that I peered into and I saw bamboo ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

The grove was quite a maze(ing) and surprisingly spanned a larger area than I thought. Weaving through the paths, we snapped away at the tall stretches of bamboo. The grove was so expansive that we had to cut the visit short, due to how much time was left in the day.

Upon exiting, we leisurely strolled to the nearest station, taking us to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Fushimi+Inari+Taisha/@34.9671402,135.770483,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60010f153d2e6d21:0x7b1aca1c753ae2e9!8m2!3d34.9671402!4d135.7726717">Fushimi Inari Taisha</a>. A shrine found at the base of Mt. Inari, but perhaps more known for its numerous Torii stretching for miles on the hike to the top.

It was going to take about an hour to get there. Nearing 17:00, the sun was setting and the race against time was on.

We lost. On the bright side <sup>or what was left of it</sup>, it was still a really cool sight.

It was just amazing seeing the torii line stretching as far as the eyes could see. The full hike takes about 2-3hrs for a round trip. 3/5 of us made it 1/3 of the way up, since night had fallen and the trail was only repeating itself but in a less interesting manner.

Being night-time, it was hard to tell if we were lost, as the trail seamlessly blended with the side streets and took us down housing areas. Believing in the heart of the cards, we managed to get out just fine.

</div>

Now, we hadn’t really eaten since morning so you could bet your bottom dollar I was hungry. At the base of the mountain and off to the side of the shrine, was a small avenue of food stalls. Alluring smells would try to lure me in but as hungry as I was, I held off for the dinner to come. While we waited for Alex and Wilson, we just browsed around the shops nearby.

:fast_forward: and we’re back in Kyoto central. As there was still time, we hit up the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Pokemon+Center+Kyoto/@35.0028264,135.766117,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x600108959eaa69ad:0x4ceb5b05d2abf1c1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60010895746f6189:0xd86ee488ecc794b5!8m2!3d35.0028264!4d135.7683057">Kyoto Pokémon Centre</a> branch. Once again, time was of the essence; this time, _we_ won. Though the good feeling didn't last long as the centre had nothing (for me). No giant plush, no artwork or even socks that weren’t for kids; the range just didn’t appeal to me. Tiringly, I walked out only with a juice pack in hand, because thirst :stuck_out_tongue: (juice was cheap but you could taste the artificial sickly sweetness).

21:00 was rolling around and a meal was long overdue. Tonight’s menu was at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Ramen+Sen+No+Kaze/@35.004578,135.7653413,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600108944803e8c5:0x19df4690dc158829!8m2!3d35.004578!4d135.76753">‘Ramen Sen no Kaze’</a>, a fantastic ramen restaurant. With no space to seat the five of us, we were told to wait 30-40mins. We’ve gone all day without food, what’s another couple minutes ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

We ended up in WEGO, a clothes store just around the corner. I'm not much of a clothes shopper so I didn’t get anything, but the others did. As time went on, I noticed an employee was eyeing us a lot. At first, I thought she was checking us out :smirk: but I felt it get more hostile as Alex and Wilson continued to try on clothes. It wasn't just me as Alex agreed with my sentiments, but we thought nothing more of it. After some back and forth between outfits, we returned downstairs and re-joined with the other two. They were still shopping around, so we hung around longer. And like before, the mood felt a bit _off_...

The ladies paid for their things and we leave ready to dine. With hands full of goods, we should have been feeling good but we didn’t. Why was the mood was so sour in there? As it turned out, the shop was due to close aaaand we overstayed our welcome by at _least_ half an hour... :grimacing:

Red faced with embarrassment, we scurried back to the restaurant. It was 22:00 now and I normally eat dinner at 17:00, so you can imagine just how hungry I was.

Each of us ordered something different and each one was just a bowl of heaven, it was delicious. The creamy but light broths, the rich flavours and the slices of cha siu... ugh it was just so good. I cleaned the bowl so well it was practically brand new. The servings were ± ¥1000 with extras at a couple hundred extra yen. Service is top notch and the setting had a nice chill atmosphere. If you're in the area, do make an effort to eat here - you won’t regret it. Eating here was, hands down, my favourite meal of the whole trip.

Back home, it was a quiet night of banter, perfectly warm showers and perfectly warm trips to the loo. I laid my body to rest, keen for the new day. Alex being extra keen as we were visiting the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Yamazaki+Distillery/@34.8923552,135.6722264,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60010363f5516cf9:0xa1f6b7e0e0166d1d!8m2!3d34.8923552!4d135.6744151">Suntory Yamazaki Distillery</a>.
