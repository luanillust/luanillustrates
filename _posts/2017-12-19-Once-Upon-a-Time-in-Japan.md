Kiss yo' early start goodbye and say <a href="https://youtu.be/VQ03WpqlpCI?t=1m15s">hello</a> to our dearest late start. But hey... I didn't mind today :open_mouth: <sup>(who is this imposter?)</sup>.

A quick nom nom stop at the station provided the day’s lunch, given that I didn't have a clue as to what food establishments were out there.

Today’s trekking tour through the Kiso Valley led us through <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Magome,+Nakatsugawa,+Gifu+Prefecture+508-0502,+Japan/@35.5271665,137.5659074,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x601cb71add823007:0x7d766e65361116fa!8m2!3d35.5259642!4d137.5667895?hl=en">Magome</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E5%A6%BB%E7%B1%A0%E5%AE%BF/@35.5777208,137.5931631,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x601cb7e4a598bb33:0x87bc2c35315036f6!8m2!3d35.5777208!4d137.5953518?hl=en">Tsumago</a>, small towns that served as pit stops for the trading travellers that often frequented the strenuous hike. What was so special about this place that we travelled hours from Nagoya to visit? Amazingly, the towns have been preserved to uphold the appearance it once did centuries ago. Going as far as not allowing vehicles to pass through the main roads and hiding power lines.

Coming off the bus was like stepping into a <a href="https://youtu.be/J9wqjEBHmMY?t=38s">time slip</a>. It was a beautiful sight before me and the gorgeous sight-seeing was going to last the odd 10kms :heart_eyes:. In between the towns, the hike weaved in and out of the wildlands, occasionally crossing back into modern society with its well kept roads.

The hike was a fantastic time with: stunning sceneries, rambunctious ringing of bear bells echoing through the mountain, good friends, minimal tourists and finding fat stacks of yen. And as much effort it takes to make your way out, the payout is very much worth it.

:fast_forward: back to Nagoya and we rendezvous with our one and only <sup><sup>fake</sup></sup>boi. Only to separate, once again, to find some grub. Stumbling into <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Esca+underground+shopping+center/@35.1702156,136.8803616,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xff8054343d33ab!8m2!3d35.1702156!4d136.8803616">ESCA</a>, an _underground_ shopping complex below Nagoya station, we <sub>(well, most of us)</sub> found the night’s menu. 

I found myself at the tables of <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E3%81%8D%E3%81%97%E3%82%81%E3%82%93%E4%BA%AD/@35.1691906,136.8788018,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x600376e647bffda5:0x881f1844173204eb!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x600376e61a49b519:0x88c24b7579dd462c!2z44GN44GX44KB44KT5Lqt!8m2!3d35.1709425!4d136.8801178!3m4!1s0x600376e61a49b519:0x88c24b7579dd462c!8m2!3d35.1709425!4d136.8801178">Kishimen-tei</a>, where I had a curry kishimen<sup>(?)</sup>. A flat noodle dish that seems to be a Nagoya thing. The serving was massive and piping hot :weary: but falls short with an average taste and not so nice pricing.

Closing the last night in Nagoya was a quick trip to the shopping strip and an unwanted return to the bnb... Having barely scraped the surface of what Nagoya had to offer, we had to move on. Up next, we hit up Hakuba to hit up the slopes. Thanks for reading and join me next time as I tumble down the slope of embarrassment.
