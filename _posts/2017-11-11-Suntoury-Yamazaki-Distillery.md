It was going to be the first of many late starts, but today was an exception as Vivian landed a job interview! The moment we landed, Viv had received word about it but seeing as we were miles away from home, things weren't looking too bright. Much to her surprise, the employer agreed to interview her through the wonders of the internet that was video calling. As Vivian was busy with that, Alex and Wilson were snoring away peacefully.

Leaving Carolyn and I to ride around the lovely neighbourhood. _If_ we could get on the bikes to begin with. It took forever figuring out how to move the kickstand :confounded:. Simply pushing on it directly wasn’t doing it and I would often feel like I'm about to break it... After battling around with it, we finally figured it out. It needed to be pressed down on this switch type thing and _then_ pushed... nice theft <sup>/idiot</sup> deterrent.

Without wasting anymore time, we set off with no particular destination in mind. Just a simple tour around the neighbourhood with a quick 7-Eleven breakfast stop.

While I do enjoy cycling in Adelaide, the casual and lax nature of riding here was just so alluring. Not having to wear a helmet on casual rides like this one was freeing as the wind blows through my hair as opposed to sweat. Footpaths and cycling paths were smooth and level, odd elevations, bumps or dips were non-existent and, most importantly, _clear_ of anything tire puncturing. The amount of broken glass, loose gravel or leftover construction filth that I have ridden over... :triumph: So many of the decent roads I traverse back in Adelaide have been ruined but here it was okay. It was my cycling safe-haven. It was such a joy.

Back at the apartment, Vivian had finished her video call and the boys were still asleep... causing us to miss the train out due to them getting ready (or lack thereof). However! Thanks to them, Google Maps decided that _now_ was a good time as any to show a simpler route. A direct train out that would get us there on time, if not earlier. Not once did this route show up during my extensive planning. Geee _thanks_, Google.

From the station, it was a lovely walk through the neighbourhood until we timely arrived at reception, a little booth found at the side of the massive building.

Following the path pointed out by reception's eloquent explanation, we reached a hall where we joined the other tour goers and guide. Our tour guide was fluent in both English and Japanese but would mostly explain in English anyway, despite us having English commentary devices.

The tour lasted just over an hour and we were given an insight into their facilities, processes and products. Truly a sight to behold.

My favourite part was when we were taken down to the cellar where endless rows of barrels were kept. All accompanied by that fantastic musky smell lingering in the air.

The tour finishes classily with a whiskey tasting. For each person, there were four glasses with three different samples. With the last one being another single malt sample, where we all turned into bartenders and collectively made highballs. Not that it mattered, because alcohol tastes like the butt of the earth. Though, I liked #2 with its fruity undertones, making it somewhat bearable. What was more than bearable were the snacks, they were delicious. There was a mixed bag of nuts where the coating was just :ok_hand: and some small chocolate blocks.

This whole tour was just ¥1000! Talk about value. The tour was an enjoyable learning experience and I wholeheartedly recommend visiting, even if you're not a fan of alcohol, <sub>like me.</sub>

With our glasses "sipped" dry <sub>or left untouched,</sub> the group parted ways and were left to browse the gift shop. Here, they sold all kinds of whiskey, whiskey knick-knacks and the best thing in the shop: snacks.

Alex and Wilson both purchased an 18 year Yamazaki Single Malt bottle for about ¥33000 (sub $400 AUD). They <a href="https://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/DM_550634/yamazaki-18-year-old-japanese-whisky-700ml">retail for $800</a> back home... _bargain_. While the boys invested into their liquid gold, I invested into my solid gold (the aforementioned glorious snacks). In my basket, I had ‘Otona no Kohaku’ Pocky, a pack of jerky and a pack of these pasta snacks. I regrettably only bought some just to try out. Had I tried them then and there, would I have bought out their inventory. They were _so damn good_.

The Pocky tasted nice but wasn’t anything special. Drawn in by its refined understated packaging, I just had to try some. Inside the cylindrical container were six individual packets as opposed to the usual singular bundle of Pocky. The taste was definitely different to the original. As its name suggests (lit. translated adult’s amber), it had a mature profile with its rich dark chocolate coating and subtle hints of malt in the biscuit. While it is intended to be paired with whiskey, they tasted fine without the alcoholic pairing.

Bacon jerky, or what the official site describes as ‘fragrant treats’, were pretty tasty. With other flavours like cheese, salmon and mixed nuts, it was quite difficult to make my decision. I found them to be quite sweet but as I chewed, more savoury flavours arose and a slight peppery kick invites itself to finish it off.

Lastly, the _pièce de résistance_: the pasta snacks. My favourite of the bunch. The highlight of the trip – ok, slight exaggeration but they’re _really_ good. Packed in a plain foil Ziploc bag, they’re quite passable on first glance but these things were, without a doubt, the best thing out of the shop. The bite-sized fried pasta pieces were just packed full of flavour and the nice crisp crunch rounded out the eating experience. They were so good that I found myself constantly reaching for more, grabbing handfuls every time. We ended up finishing the packet within the hour, even though I was trying to ration them :sweat_smile:.

Past the trap of the gift shop, we were met with a cool whiskey gallery and tasting bar where we hung around until hunger got the better of us. It was 15:00 afterall...

Today’s lunch menu was at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Vegans+cafe+and+restaurant/@34.9597643,135.765479,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60010f6db4d1555f:0x33a640f05673256e!8m2!3d34.9597599!4d135.7676677?hl=en">Vegans Café & Restaurant</a>. We had planned to go yesterday but they weren’t open (good to check these details and not get sprung with surprises...). What was a 15min walk from the nearest station turned into what felt like foreverrrr. But! It was a nice scenic neighbourhood walk.

The place was cosy and warm, much like its welcoming staff. With such an extensive menu, the time taken to order was equally so. Eventually, we had on the table: bowls of ramen, pizza, a teeny rice bowl and a pita sandwich. For a sweet finish, we had some green tea and banana “milkshakes” (read ice cream). The food was fantastic and relatively cheap. It was full of flavour, filling and healthy <sup>(citation needed)</sup>.

After finishing our meal, we decided that now was a good time for a valuable lesson. As the usual procedure goes, we asked for the bill (ビル). We chatted away awaiting for the staff’s return. As they came back, we noticed that they didn’t return with the slip of paper or little folder but a cold bottle of beer (ビール) in hand.

:confused:

Bringing up key words like <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5Tx2FN9vO8?t=21s">money</a> and finished didn't clear up the misunderstanding. The waiter was still dumbfounded as we racked our brains coming up with the answer. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it came to us. Check! It was <a href="https://youtu.be/LjH0tB3Q37o?t=24s">_CHECK_</a> (チェック).

:fast_forward: back to Kyoto central.

Here, we trawled through <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E9%8C%A6%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E5%95%86%E5%BA%97%E8%A1%97%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88/@35.005008,135.7627129,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6001089ccd8ccb4f:0xb69ea31001ec6c9c!8m2!3d35.005008!4d135.7649016?hl=en">Nishiki Market</a>; a long strip of food stalls, fresh groceries and the odd souvenir shops. Being the latter half of the day, it wasn’t _as_ busy and the stock had dwindled down a bit but that didn’t stop the influx of people coming and going. Though our time spent there was short, I still enjoyed the pleasurable walk down the lively strip.

Shortly after, we visited the Yasaka Shrine after my embarrassingly unsuccessful attempt at finding these particular picturesque streets of Gion :weary:. The shrine is always open and being the evening, the place wasn't littered with people. Free to view at our own pace, we admired the big gate out front and the array of lanterns at the centre stage. The lantern's glow emanated throughout the grounds making for quite a pretty sight. My photos don't do the shrine justice.

We wandered the district a little more before hunger kicked in again. A <a href="https://youtu.be/sNZvE5Jk7Qs?t=1m13s">Google search</a> led us to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Gion+Kappa+Restaurant/@35.0053387,135.7699025,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1skappa+kyoto!3m4!1s0x600108ea8f6067f1:0xd08787a6ee1aee87!8m2!3d35.0050326!4d135.7730631?hl=en">Gion Kappa Restaurant</a> (when we went, it was known as Kappa Kyoto). The restaurant is an izakaya, where meals are more like small cheap eats. Speaking of, the food was nothing to brag home about. It was a passable meal that didn't suck or amaze. What I didn't like was how long it took for the orders to come out. The place wasn't packed or anything and we didn't order much sooo...
Adding to my nitpicks, I reckon the staff could've been more welcoming, especially with the warm attention the guys at Vegans Café & Restaurant gave.

Post-meal, we didn't do much and headed back to our humble penthouse suite where we enjoyed another night full of antics and banter. Tomorrow was going to be a full day travelling all around Kyoto and its alliterative "K" spots. Thanks for reading.
