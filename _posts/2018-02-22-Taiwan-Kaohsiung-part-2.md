Breezing through breakfast, I dashed out the hotel to get some quick snaps of what I couldn’t last night. Having viewed it under the glow of dim street lamps and now the sunlight, I can _safely_ say that it was a better viewing experience during the day :thumbsup:.

Hitting the road for a short trip, we’re taken to our first location of the day - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E4%BD%9B%E5%85%89%E5%B1%B1%E4%BD%9B%E9%99%80%E7%B4%80%E5%BF%B5%E9%A4%A8+Fo+Guang+Shan+Buddha+Museum/@22.7562447,120.4412254,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x346e16af36de702b:0xa70c53fa8f67593c!8m2!3d22.7557018!4d120.4453197?hl=en">Fo Guang Shan (佛光山)</a>, the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. And boooy is it biiig~ The path to the main hall was already a wonder in itself, so you can imagine how wonderful it was when we reached the Fo Guang Big Buddha <sup>(it was aight)</sup>. Inside the main hall was a beautiful wide-open space, home to numerous exhibits and displays, most of which were left unseen due to the nature of the tour.

Right at the centre was probably the main attraction of the Main Hall; a large praying room which was quite spectacular. Unfortunately, the room prohibited any image recording. Fortunately, I am quite the <a href="https://youtu.be/J_CFBjAyPWE?t=1m16s">bad boy</a> and have the jankiest photos to show for it.

<div class="imageset">

	</div>
</div>

Meanwhile, the typical Chinese<sup><sup>*操nese</sup></sup> tourists unashamedly whip out their phones in broad daylight... Annoyances aside, the ambience was quite mystical. Especially with the glow emanating from the floor tiles and the surrounding wall of infinity mirror effects. Then you have, at centre stage, a shining statue of the thousand-armed thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara.

Upon exiting, my brother and I decided to move ahead of the group. Just a quick wander about on the floors above. Having strayed a little _too_ far for a little _too_ long, we rushed back to an empty atrium :grimacing:. Scurrying around, we attempted to find the group but they were long gone. Then, in the corner of my eye, I noticed a couple from our group. Staff were leading them away and some quick thinking on my part gave chase <sup>-blindly</sup>. The four of us were now waiting in a line for who knows what. Standing there twiddling my thumbs, I was starting to think our group was never here. As I thought that, we were ushered into this theatre room where we collected 3D glasses... :sweat_smile: Definitely not on our program. Unable to back out, no thanks to our communication barriers, I had to sit there and suffer. It was hilariously terrible. As if it wasn’t bad enough that we were slowly losing the others, this "feature" film was completely in Chinese and had the quality of animation typically found in generic trashy YouTube Kids videos.

After an endless suppression of laughter amongst the many mixed emotions, we got moving to find the tour group. Much to my surprise, they weren't that far ahead. Quickly catching up on the missed sights, we made our way out, somehow still ahead of the group.

</div>

As there was still a fair bit of time before we were scheduled to regroup, we jetted off again. Like a side quest, we walked off the main track and headed towards the Twin Pavilions, a magnificent structure enveloped in a brilliance of gold. While nice, it ain’t no Kinkaku-ji, that’s for sure.

Remember how we left most of the main hall untouched? Well, can you believe that what I’ve presented thus far was only half of what there is to see at this gorgeous location. Just down the road from the Memorial Centre was another site! The Fo Guang Shan Monastery, itself. Just crazy to think how massive this place is.

One hot pot buffet later, we were on the road again, off to our next attraction – the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Lotus+Pond/@22.6838418,120.2917663,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x346e059e2f57f019:0x627969fe1eec1f2c!8m2!3d22.6833323!4d120.2966989?hl=en">Lotus Pond (蓮池潭)</a>, a fabricated lake plastered with marvellous sights to behold. Except for the water… yeah, it's yuck. With only a short amount of time (again), I was only able to route my way around half of the area. Jetting towards the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E5%8C%97%E6%A5%B5%E4%BA%AD/@22.6849541,120.2953009,19z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1z5YyX5qW15Lqt!3m4!1s0x346e059e33855ec5:0x1a189db2552ba253!8m2!3d22.685204!4d120.2954242?hl=en">Beiji Pavillion (北極亭)</a> first, I worked my way backwards towards where we started at the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dragon+and+Tiger+Pagodas/@22.6804871,120.2933616,18z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1z5YyX5qW15Lqt!3m4!1s0x0:0x526d3613753c80c7!8m2!3d22.6805101!4d120.2923882?hl=en">Dragon & Tiger Pagodas (龍虎塔)</a>.

</div>

As my parents were miserably left in the dust, I made short work of the distance before me. With a slight puff, I lost even more of my breath looking down the walkway leading to the temple with the Xuan Wu statue towering above it. From start to finish, the walkway's rails were decorated with individually unique statues. The amount of detailing and character etched into each one was astounding; it really was an incredible sight. Meanwhile, the main statue was _nheh_.

</div>

Next in line were the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Spring+and+Autumn+Pavilions/@22.6822687,120.2916354,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x346e059f5a186e1f:0x17a2f46d40d81fb6!8m2!3d22.6822687!4d120.2927297?hl=en">Spring & Autumn Pavilions (春秋閣)</a>. This was quite an interesting landmark, thanks to the peculiar dragon hallway. At no risk of your life, you can safely enter the dragon and view the less than stellar artwork adorning the walls. Word of caution though, if you’re not a fan of incense, I’d steer clear; it’s as though the murals were painted with the stuff. Past the dragon is a walkway to an _ehh_ pagoda. Moving on.

</div>

Back to the start again, and I have left the _meh_ ‘til last. Like the dragon before, the Dragon & Tiger Pagodas also have a novel entryway, but nowhere nearly as fascinating. Past that, the scalable pagoda towers offers _a_ view... And as a bonus, throw in the pollution filter :ok_hand:.

Leaving the Lotus Pond, it marked the end of our attraction viewing for the day. Up next, we made a quick stop at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Chun+Shui+Tang/@22.5957418,120.3051467,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!2m1!1schun+shui+tang!3m4!1s0x346e0369cd39a833:0x16ddec177cac89b5!8m2!3d22.5957418!4d120.3073354?hl=en">Chan Shui Tang (春水堂)</a> where our local guide singlehandedly brought us twenty odd cups of bubz :heart_eyes:. Again, it tastes good but it's not sweet enough. I _neeeed_ the sugar, yo.

Continuing the trend of going in reverse, we washed down our drinks with a confectionary overload at the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E7%B6%AD%E6%A0%BC%E9%A4%85%E5%AE%B6/@22.6517192,120.287799,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x346e04506e3f53a7:0x56a9bd9f87ba0ba!2z57at5qC86aSF5a62!8m2!3d22.6488746!4d120.2926403!3m4!1s0x346e04506e3f53a7:0x56a9bd9f87ba0ba!8m2!3d22.6488746!4d120.2926403?hl=en">Castle of Golden Pineapple (維格餅家)</a>. Eating my weight in samples, I was quite the happy chappy :smile:. It was here that I discovered my new-found love – pineapple cake. Making my first time <sup><sup><sup>キャー</sup></sup></sup> even greater, we were sampling a _fresh_ batch 🤤.

Only in for the (most welcome) money shakedown, it's very likely that we missed any other offerings the place had in store - it was a large building after all.

Squeezing us even drier of our money, we headed to the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Uni-UStyle+Department+Store+Kaohsiung+Branch/@22.5948831,120.3049037,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x346e0372ebc9d327:0x92317d11de68daf9!8m2!3d22.5948831!4d120.3070924?hl=en">Uni-UStyle department store</a>. <sup>hah</sup> Jokes on them, I didn’t _have_ any money to spend <sup>ha <sup>ha..<sup> ha</sup></sup></sup>. Like Japan, I'm amazed by how these small-ish countries have such massive and extravagant shopping complexes. Then I look at Australia and its piss-poor selection. Wait- Why do I care? I only ever shop online.

Having spent nothing but time, it was time to grab (an unexceptional) dinner and call it a night. As I have just about discovered everything within walking distance, I stayed cooped up in my room, enjoying that hella fast internet.

And with that, it marks the end of the Kaohsiung leg of the trip. Thank you for reading and join me next time as we head towards the central regions and visit the city of Taichung.
