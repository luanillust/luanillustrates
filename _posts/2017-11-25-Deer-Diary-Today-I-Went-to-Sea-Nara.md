New day = new slow start :grinning:. Previously, I mentioned that I barely explored Osaka. This was the result of Osaka acting as a hub of sorts for the day trips made out to neighbouring cities. Like today's neat trip out to Nara, a place known for its deer and home to many world heritage sites.

The hour long trip on the Osaka loop line led us to the nice neighbourhood of Nara.

As the wheels on the bus went round and round, we reached the first of the multitude of attractions - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/K%C5%8Dfuku-ji/@34.681489,135.8294322,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x60013988b23decb3:0x11830f4737834593!2sK%C5%8Dfuku-ji!8m2!3d34.682883!4d135.8322271!3m4!1s0x60013988b23decb3:0x11830f4737834593!8m2!3d34.682883!4d135.8322271?hl=en">Kofuku-ji</a>, a temple ground.

</div>

Or more appropriately, deer. As I mentioned before, Nara is known for its deer populace. So while the guys spent their amount of time with the deer, I went off with my dear to the actual attraction.

<div class="imageset">

	</div>
</div>

Kofuku-ji, for the most part, was free but had select complexes behind a small fee. Between all the landmarks was a surprisingly large amount of open space that had the right amount of tourists: none <sup>...well, close to.</sup>

<div class="imageset">

</div>

Following the blue dotted road, we reached the secluded attraction that was <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/K%C5%8Dfuku-ji,+Noboriojicho,+Nara,+Nara+Prefecture,+Japan/Yoshikien+Garden,+60-1+Noboriojicho,+Nara,+Nara+Prefecture+630-8213,+Japan/@34.6841877,135.8332782,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x60013988b23decb3:0x11830f4737834593!2m2!1d135.8322271!2d34.682883!1m5!1m1!1s0x6001398fe4d15555:0x71989ea099142834!2m2!1d135.8368676!2d34.6852295?hl=en">Yoshikien Garden</a>. Routing through quiet side streets and picturesque alleys, we arrived at a small booth where a nice lady took our nationalities instead of our money :ok_hand:.

</div>

While Yoshikien is free, the adjacent garden of <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Isuien+Garden/@34.6855566,135.8350219,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6001398fe391f25b:0xd7d5ae2d36accf55!8m2!3d34.6855566!4d135.8372106?hl=en">Isuien</a> is not, with admission of ¥900. Not that it mattered as its doors closed for winter. Speaking of winter, there wasn’t much blooming in the garden but that didn't make it any less beautiful. Like Kofukuji, the garden was nice and empty with a calming sense of peace.

Leaving the peaceful gardens brought us back to a populated <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/T%C5%8Ddai-ji/@34.6889851,135.8376271,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600139907a0876dd:0xf890ac3f9dd53c8f!8m2!3d34.6889851!4d135.8398158?hl=en">Todai-ji</a>, another temple ground. And by chance, my hawk eyes spotted some familiar faces within the populated crowds (the guys I left behind). Regrouped, we wandered the vast grounds... to play with deer. Why I didn't proceed past the paywalls is beyond me.

It wasn't just all deer, just so you know! There were souvenir stops.

Before heading back to Osaka, we visited <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kasuga-taisha/@34.6813804,135.8461969,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x600139c06bb06ad5:0x4c97e78382e39596!8m2!3d34.6813804!4d135.8483856?hl=en">Kasuga Tasisha</a>, a popular Nara Shinto shrine. You may have noticed today’s theme of visiting attraction grounds but not the main attraction itself :sweat_smile:. Like the other attractions, the grounds were free to roam but going further invited a small fee that I neglected... While I can’t comment on beyond what I visited, I can say that for what I did see, it was a spectacular sight. The abundance of lanterns found scattered across the grounds were stunning. Whether they were grounded moss covered stone lanterns or the hanging cold metal ones, it was enlanterning.

Having had enough Nara for the day, we decided to return to good 'ol Osaka. On the way, we stumbled into some performances of amateur sumo and noh (Japanese theatre). A nice surprise that was a feast for the eyes.

We were against the clock now. Closing time for the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Osaka+Aquarium+Kaiyukan/@34.6545182,135.4267758,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e8f48c0da9cd:0x6f83c520ae082ccc!8m2!3d34.6545182!4d135.4289645?hl=en">Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan</a> was nearing and we wouldn't want a rushed visit now, would we?

</div>

As we made our timely arrival, crowds had gathered in droves towards the courtyard for this speech. As the speaker uttered their last words, a string of lights buzzed on, radiating its luminance and bringing to life the sea creatures that had gone unnoticed <sup>by me.</sup>

<div class="imageset">

</div>

After that bedazzling feature, we shuffled our way through the line to purchase a costly ¥3000 combo ticket. Providing us entry into the aquarium and a ride on the Ferris wheel. Worth it? _nheeeeeh_... it wasn’t bad.

<div class="imageset">

It didn’t feel like it when we were moving around but, ultimately, the aquarium is massive. Passing through the typical aqua tunnel and few exhibits leads you to this tall escalator taking you to the top. Which was really fascinating as we had to progress through the facility by going downwards in a spiral as the centre is occupied by a giant tank, housing the innumerable amount of sea creatures. While the tank was the centre of attention, smaller exhibits adorned the walls in the spaces between.

Reaching the lower levels presented us with more exhibits, the touchy feely floor and, of course, the gift shop.

The night's menu was planned for <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kuma+Kafe/@34.6555389,135.4293408,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e88b480b21c9:0x725f06ceda198eff!8m2!3d34.6555389!4d135.4315295?hl=en">Kuma Kafe</a>, a place just minutes from the aquarium. Ready to chow down, I was quickly on the move as time was ticking. Brimming with excitement, I entered only to be greeted by disappointment. They weren't accepting any more customers :sob:.

With hopes crushed, we headed back to Osaka central. This led us to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7+(El+Pancho)/@34.674829,135.4990053,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e710ae52616b:0x60bc0a43d7ab3ba9!8m2!3d34.674829!4d135.501194?hl=en">El Pancho</a>, a Mexican restaurant. Located in a building within a shopping complex, it can be found on the xth floor. While most details are hazy, I do recall the elevator being decked out with stickers and tags.

Upon entering the saloon styled door, I was in awe by the restaurant's décor. Though my picture shows a well lit place, it's been boosted a few stops. It was actually fairly dim and where we were seated, lighting was practically non-existent.

I didn't like my meal... :weary:. Food was saltier than tears shed from not eating at Kuma Kafe :cry:. Ordering two items was a costly mistake as the filling was the same: sodium. Though I didn't enjoy my meal, Carolyn seemed to enjoy hers. So tread with caution.

Powering through the last ounces of salt, we <sup>(me, uncomfortably)</sup> made our way home to wander the neighbourhood and called it a night. Thanks for reading and join me next time as we travel to Kobe.
