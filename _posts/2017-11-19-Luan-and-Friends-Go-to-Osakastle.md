Another day, another late start. Good thing Osaka was only a half hour train ride away from Kyoto (on a normie train, at that). Bidding the apartment adieu, we strained ourselves with _slightly_ heavier luggage down the flights of stairs before draaagging ourselves to the station.

Not all bnbs were flexible with their check in times, as was the case for Osaka, so we left our luggage at the train station. While the stations do have lockers, the huge cases that Alex and I brought would barely squeeze into the lockers. Gratefully, baggage rooms are a thing. When looking up about this, I only found info of one at <a href="https://themadtraveler.com/travel-tips/storing-luggage-in-osaka-station">Shin-Osaka station</a> (scroll to the bottom). However, I soon discovered that <a href="https://www.osakastation.com/osaka-station-lockers-and-luggage-storage/">Osaka station had a baggage room</a> (again, scroll to the bottom). Where we had left ours, it was a cheap ¥500 for the day (9:00 – 20:00) and the folks were super friendly. With our luggage left in their care, we went to care for our stomachs.

While I marched on ahead, ready to leave the station, I didn't realise that the others wanted to dine at the station. As is always the case, there was a lot of choice... too much choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/eVTXPUF4Oz4?t=1m9s">In the end</a>, I wound up at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Kushikatsu+Daruma+Lucua+Osaka+Store/@34.7031961,135.4941063,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x6000e68dc1671a6f:0x4ceb5b05038adcc6!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e68d9521f2ad:0x38f0f76cc2337ba8!8m2!3d34.7031961!4d135.496295?hl=en">Daruma Lucua</a>, a kushikatsu place.

Here, you ordered through the touch menu found in the booth and, much to my surprise, the food was delivered on a conveyor belt! It was only when I heard the whirring of the machinery, did I realise that my tray of fried ~~obesity~~ heaven arrived.

Compared to Gion Kappa, it was no competition that this was better. The breading had a nice crispiness and wasn't too thick, flavours were good and the service was stellar. Especially when they showed much interest in my hat :blush:.

Upon finishing our meals, we headed off for <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Osaka+Castle/@34.6873153,135.5240126,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e0cd5c283afd:0xf01d07d5ca11e41!8m2!3d34.6873153!4d135.5262013?hl=en">Osaka Castle</a>.

Depending on the entry point, there are various paths to navigate through to reach the castle, itself.

</div>

I had read many comments about the castle's interior being somewhat of a disappointment, due to the hamming up of tourism and modernisation. While I didn’t fall into the tourist trap, the others did and were in agreeance with the points made. The chance to view the cityscape from the top shouldn’t lure you in either, as it was “nothing spectacular”.

</div>

But that’s the interior, what about the exterior? You could admire the intricate architectural design of the beautiful landmark, roam around the castle grounds and enjoy the jovial setting, filled with food and cheerful chatter from people alike. All _freely_.

It was in that jovial setting that I was intrigued by this Cremia ice cream stall. Lured in by its premium taglines and looks, I succumbed to its high price of ¥550. And... it didn’t blow my mind. It was delicious, sure, but it wasn’t the best damn ice cream I’ve ever had. The soft serve boasted about its creaminess and I can attest to that. Complementing the rich ice cream was a unique cone. The texture reminded me of shortbread in that it crumbled away but as it did, it also melted. I found that the cone was distinctly Asian sweet, if that makes sense... It wasn’t just a pure sugary sweetness but an amalgamation of subtle sweet flavours. This wasn’t exclusive to Osaka Castle or anything either, it's fairly commonplace around Japan as a chain stall.

Due to our time schedule, we ended up only visiting the castle. As it was now quite late into the day, we left to check in. :fast_forward: past the long journey back to Shin-Osaka station, reclaiming our luggage, travelling back in the direction we just came from and dumping our stuff at the bnb to hit the streets… :unamused:

Being my <a href="https://youtu.be/MigfH7KmiEg?t=46s">first time</a> in Osaka, I couldn't wait to visit <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Dotonbori/@34.6687235,135.4991066,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e713818af9fd:0xb8bb1326b48ba590!8m2!3d34.6687235!4d135.5012953?hl=en">Dotonbori</a>; a hugely popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Everywhere you looked, neon signs loomed over the canal, the streets parallel and the hundreds of individuals walking it. And if neon signs weren't enough, the extravagant decorative shop pieces are sure to pull you in.

All this enlightenment was short-lived since hunger was getting the better of Carolyn, so we headed to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Organic+%26+Vegetarian+Cafe+Atl/@34.6718493,135.4995883,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6000e7114caa5555:0xa61506c78d1b8eac!8m2!3d34.6718493!4d135.501777?hl=en">Atl (アトル) Organic & Vegetarian Café</a>. Like a heat seeking missile, sights were set on the restaurant and chances to soak in the Osaka nightlife were lost. And in this missile’s wake, we left the others trailing behind for the rest of the night. 

The café can be difficult to spot since it’s wedged narrowly between its neighbouring buildings, with subtle signage. Though, its small space doesn’t undermine the relaxed homely feel. And being only metres from the hectic streets, the quietness was welcomed. 

Keeping us warm that night was the heater and the friendliness of the staff/owners/couple. They were well attentive to our needs and made sure we had a nice experience.

</div>

The night’s menu was a choice between a few sets. Carolyn chose the set with the potato <sup>(?)</sup> tart, this... block  of ingredients and creamy risotto. Separate from the set, was cake and coffee/tea for dessert. The food tasted good, especially the cake. _Oh muh guuhh~_ it was gooood. Each bite of the warm cake just oozed decadence.

</div>

However, I wish I could only praise this place. With a high price (around ¥2000+ for that meal) to pay for what little Carolyn got was disappointing, to say the least. 

Now it was my turn. At first, it was a wander around the streets for anything that appealed to me. Eventually turning into a Google search for the most well rated since there was (again) too much choice. _Then_ it was a search for an appealing and well rated place that didn’t have queues. Where did this long journey leave me? On the doorstep of a semi-chain restaurant by the name of <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Chibo/@34.6680646,135.4986901,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1schibo+osaka!3m4!1s0x6000e714e0f7db93:0x9bdc7e61a5f722f1!8m2!3d34.6688089!4d135.5039701?hl=en">Chibo</a>, a place that served okonomiyaki and didn't quite fit the bill of either of my requisites :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:.

Here, the food was prepped behind the scenes and served on a hot plate to be kept warm. As a quick appetiser, I ordered these egg wrapped meat rolls. Through the piping hotness was a delicious taste sensation.

A good start to another belated meal that only got better with the arrival of the star of the show, a seafood okonomiyaki. While the flavours were good, I loved the crispy grilled sides a whole lot more. I _revel_ in crispy bits - crusty edges of cakes, end pieces of meat, bottom of rice pot etc. And to have _two_ crispy sides... :raised_hands:. All made possible thanks to the Osaka style of okonomiyaki – or better yet... _Osakamiyaki_. With this style, the batter is combined prior to cooking as opposed to having the different layers cooked separately <sup>(citation needed)</sup>.

Chibo wasn’t anything special; the food wasn’t bad and the prices were meh. It’s not a must visit place but recommendable for grabbing a bite. After finishing, we trotted home, enjoying each other’s company until the others joined us for another night of fun banter.

Tonight was the only time that I even remotely explored Osaka :cry:. The subsequent days left us without the chance to discover the sights lying await. It was much to my regret that I allowed trivial factors (one being laziness, unfortunately) get the better of me. Thanks for reading and come along with me next time as we travel to Nara.
