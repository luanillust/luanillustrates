description: "Days 18-19 in my 2016 Japan trip. Continuing the Tokyo leg, we scrambled about looking for lunch. Unable to at Ginza's Tsukiji Market, we had to travel far and wide. Besides that, a LOT of shopping, especially at G.Itoya and K.Itoya"

Finding ourselves in Tokyo station, we started the morning at <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/T's+TanTan+-+Tokyo+Station+Keiyo+Street/@35.6797559,139.7319033,13z/data=!3m1!5s0x60188bfbd91993eb:0xc9da05c5e162fa6a!4m8!1m2!2m1!1st's+tan+tan!3m4!1s0x60188bfbf5cb32b5:0x7ec63789e70fa29b!8m2!3d35.6797559!4d139.7669222?hl=en">T‚Äôs Tan Tan</a> to grab some brekky for Carolyn. <a href="{% post_url 2017-12-30-Tokyo-Lakitu %}#zauo" target="_blank">Judging from last night</a>, it was better this way, since she wasn‚Äôt going to appreciate where we're going next... Where, was <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Tsukiji+Market/@35.6797559,139.7319033,13z/data=!3m1!5s0x60188bfbd91993eb:0xc9da05c5e162fa6a!4m5!3m4!1s0x601889647120144f:0x57c9eadb7b62ef7f!8m2!3d35.6654861!4d139.7706668?hl=en">Tsukiji Market</a>; famous for its tuna auction and stunning array of seafood and produce. Bringing it back to T‚Äôs Tan Tan, Carolyn adores the place (went back many times) and I think it's nice, but nothing to rave on about.

Getting to Ginza was terrible. Stuck on a bus, we were caught in traffic (Hiroshima flashbacks :confounded:). It was midday and we were still sushi-less (more d√©j√† vu). With a couple hundred metres left, we were reaching Tsukiji. However, just approaching the outer markets, we could see the hectic crowds. It was apparent that we had to abandon all mannerisms and just plough through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L8eRzOYhLuw?t=1m08s">Breaking free</a> from the crowd's clutches, we finally reached the various sushi bars. Surprisingly, lines were still short, especially given the time of day.

Wanting to sleep in, we had left Wilson behind but as he was ‚Äúon his way‚Äù, we decided to wait and regroup. Wandering around, we scouted for places with the shortest wait times.

Standing around for at _least_ half an hour, there was still no sign of Wilson. Time ticked on and he‚Äôd arrived, but yet to reach us. Having provided a clear representation of our location, I didn‚Äôt think it'd be difficult to find us. Overlooking that, he managed to overcomplicate things instead, by specifying where he wasn‚Äôt <sup>wut?</sup>, and notifying us he was here, but _still_ nowhere to be found :no_mouth:.

By now, lines doubled in length and continued to build on like Lego. We eventually found Wilson and latched ourselves to one of the long lines. To which, I soon abandoned <sub>(along with Wilson <sub>& Alex, by extension</sub>)</sub> because hunger was getting the better of me. No sushi? All good, I was prepared for this. Also in the area was <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Ginza+Bairin+main+store/@35.6695489,139.7605822,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188be6207819dd:0xc3ba2e2af6143c85!8m2!3d35.6695489!4d139.7627709?hl=en">Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin</a>, a restaurant specialising in cutlet cuisine. Unprepared for another long line, I moved on. Finding a BBQ place, we strayed further out, only to find its doors closed :unamused:. Fed up with searching, we entered the neighbouring tsukemen shop.

</div>

Looking at the vending machine taking orders, I noticed that the portion sizes were all priced the same :thinking:. It was a no brainer to go with the largest one they had. Handing over my ticket, I went to freshen up. Returning to my seat, I found Vivian sitting alone... Carolyn was given the boot. Since she wasn't eating, she wasn't allowed to stay. A bit crappy, but rules are rules and it was a small place, after all. <sub><sub>A small place that barely had any customers...</sub></sub> 

Manning the restaurant were only two guys; one, grumbly and stand-offish, while the other couldn't be any more of a polar opposite.

Bearing more bad news, I soon came to learn that Viv had her bowl downgraded. Strongly advised that she wouldn't be able to finish it, I wished I was there to heed their words. Before I was able to request the same, my overkill portion arrived... and it was massive. I've made my bed... 

<div class="imageset">
	<img src="{{ baseurl }}/assets/luantics/P016/P016JPND1809.jpg" alt="an extra large serving of tsukemen noodles"/>
</div>

Chipping away at the noodle mountain, my chopsticks slowly picked at its monstrous size. Not too long into the meal, Wilson and Alex joined the mix ‚Äìish... While trying to order, the rude guy went off, muttering something that didn't sound positive. As a result, Wilson stayed and Alex didn‚Äôt. Least Carolyn wasn‚Äôt by herself now.

Hastily accepting Wilson‚Äôs offer to take a sizeable portion, I was a little better off. Though, there was still plenty left. Generally, I have my soupy noodles warm, but as tsukemen noodles are often served cold, it prolonged the meal (cold soupy noodles _suck_). It also didn't help that the food wasn't amazing either. Struggling to the last strand, I finished my meal but at the cost of something I would come to regret later on.

As Alex and Carolyn were still enjoying their meal, the rest of us went ahead with our day. Just ten minutes away was a small paradise of mine ‚Äì <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/G.IT%C5%8CYA+Stationery+Store/@35.673003,139.7651873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188be4000a0029:0x8a7da075396968c0!8m2!3d35.673003!4d139.767376?hl=en">G.Itoya</a>, a _really nice_ stationary store. Every floor is beautifully decorated and laid out with a range of products as vast as the sea. 

Reaching the 7th floor was like a stairway to heaven. Home to a variety of fine papers with stocks and colours out the wazoo. It was a shame that I couldn‚Äôt bring any home without ruining them in some way :sob:. Gimme a G.Itoya, Adelaide.

Up until now, I had been quelling an upset stomach. I was _really_ full from that meal; the sickest I ever felt. After frequenting the many flight of stairs, my body was starting to take its toll. Whether I was completely still or moving, the abdominal pain was uncomfortable, no matter what. Constantly nauseous, I attempted to spew but it was nothing but air. 

Finished with G.Itoya, we moved onto its younger sibling: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/IT%C5%8CYA+Stationery+Store/@35.6729418,139.7656368,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188be3ffe605a9:0xb24df56c5ed15c2b!8m2!3d35.6729418!4d139.7678255?hl=en">K.Itoya</a>. Here, the stationary is more focused on the arts end of things (markers, paints, canvases, sketchpads etc.). Despite K.Itoya's smaller floor count, floor space and grandeur, it was still a fantastic little shop. What wasn‚Äôt so fantastic was the nausea rising, again ü§¢.

Nearing the end of store opening hours, we left Ginza and shifted over to the neighbouring district of Akihabara, otaku central. Tempted by the many figures and collectables, I had to refrain from the needless purchases. Nothing but a whole lot of window-shopping. No dramas.

While the night was still young, I spent it at home, being the recluse I am. Whereas the others hit the town and were in their element - clubs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kRHpBFs-V4">_Woop Woop_</a>.

Last day of 2016... To think it's now 2018 :open_mouth:. What a year it had been and what better way to finish the year than to to be in Japan. It was only three years ago, on this day, I was out in the incredibly crowded Shibuya celebrating with people from all walks of life. Topping off that fun night was going to be tough but I managed to pull it off. More at six.

Trying not to wake anyone, I tiptoed out the bnb to pick up our guest.

Replacing Wilson indefinitely, Nicole re-joined us for a straightforward and uninteresting day in town. Where we shopped ‚Äòtil we needed to stop. New Year‚Äôs Eve meant turning up, and I wanted to be far from it.

As we neared the end of this trip, it's just mainly shops, shops and more shops. Due to the timing, some things weren't available and well... we did vote for it.

Now in the last few hours of 2016, everyone had left, and I was stuck with the ball and chain. Not for long... Readying my prison break, I completely emptied my duffel of its purchased contents thus far and packed in the dirty contraband, 3DS and, of course, my music. Curiously, I left behind coins... for a coin operated laundromat.

A short walk in the empty streets, led me to a (relatively) quiet laundromat. Breaking my notes at the vending machine, I acquired my small change and a warm milk tea to ward off the cold. It was only when I was putting the clothes in, did I realise that I didn‚Äôt have any detergent‚Ä¶ ü§¶. I turned to the lady behind me and asked to borrow some but she kindly pointed out that the detergent comes with its operation. :open_mouth: _Incredible_. Finishing the preparation, I had a sweet little conversation with the lady. Obviously, one sided but I still :heart:.

Bidding the lady adieu, I was left to myself. As the hum of the machines competed with my blaring tunes, I enjoyed the solitary moment with my _true_ love: games. Soooo yeah... I spent NYE doing laundry! Doesn't get better than that.

Thanks for reading and join the new me, of the New Year, as I hit the shops _ah-gain_...
