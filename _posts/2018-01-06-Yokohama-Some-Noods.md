Back to an early start for one last time, we got out the door quickly to my satisfaction :blush:. Leaving the beautiful metropolis of Tokyo, we journeyed out to an equally beautiful Yokohama, a ~~reputable tyre brand~~ port side city and one of Japan's major cities, at that. Why were we here? We were getting some sweet, sweet noods over at the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Cup+Noodles+Museum/@35.4554746,139.6367099,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60185c598b1dae11:0x4ceb5b057f554150!4m5!3m4!1s0x60185c577b6193dd:0x7368667740b93abe!8m2!3d35.4554746!4d139.6388986?hl=en">Cup Noodles Museum</a>.

</div>

Arriving ahead of schedule, we visited the superior Brickworks: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Yokohama+Red+Brick+Warehouse/@35.4555718,139.635286,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x60185cf885807149:0x94947dd82acc3d73!8m2!3d35.4526266!4d139.6429249?hl=en">Yokohama Red Brick Warehouses</a>, found in the Minato Mirai 21 area. In the marketplace styled environment, you can find unique products from the numerous shops or catch the sickest <a href="https://youtu.be/ncRUr4NcwkM?t=1m7s">egg flips</a>. Walking past the restaurant window, I was given a special look into the kitchen. Stopping to take some pics, I managed to gather a small crowd. Amazingly, the chef had his eyes fixed on us the whole time :open_mouth:.

	<sup><em>Flipping</em> awesome.</sup>

Properly running out of time, we made haste and backtracked to the museum for our reserved noodle making session. Between this and creating your own cup mix, the noodle making is inherently better (and less crowded). To partake in these activities, you’re required to make reservations. Now, they have an English site for info about the place. Reserving, however, can only be done on their Japanese site... With _a lot_ of Google translate, I was able to book myself a spot.

With no time to admire the exhibits, I presented the <a href="{% post_url 2017-11-28-Kobe-Beefing-Tears-of-Soy %}#wrongreserve" target="_blank">_correct_ reservation</a> and paid the ¥1000 combo fee (50/50 entry & making). Rushing to the creation space, dubbed as the “Chicken Ramen Factory”, we were the last few to enter... midway into the intro :persevere:. Hands sanitised, we popped on our cute aprons and bandanas, and "tuned" in for the T.V tutorial. Not that it's a cause for concern. There weren't many communication difficulties and English instructions are available.

Finishing that, we headed over to the benches and got cooking. Here, we met Komatsu, our guide/helper for the session. He was _fantastic_. Encouraging us with cheers and comments, he made the experience a really memorable one. My absolute favourite line, “fast equals delicious”, got us driven to create the best batch. Which, in turn, created a little competition. At the end of each step, he'd comment on our efforts. And like a bunch of kids, we'd compare our "grades". Great quality was rewarded with a joyful _excellent_ and anything less than stellar received a measly だいじょうぶ (i.e. an insult to the industry).

Since this activity is completed in pairs, our odd member - Wilson - paired with Komatsu. In saying that, even with his professional partner, he was still crushed by yours truly :muscle: <sup><sup>pfft</sup> Like I'd lose.</sup>

As like all dough, it needed to rest, which allowed us to work on our packet designs during the intermissions. If I recall, the stages were: make dough and knead <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> press out flat <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> roll thinner in machine <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> noodalise and cut <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> season and toss <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> fry <sup><sup>you fools</sup></sup> <sub><sup>:arrow_right:</sup></sub> seal and pack.

Seeing the fruits of our labour come to life... it was a special moment :'). Sealing the noodles in our <a href="https://youtu.be/rJnICByeL8Q?t=14s">one of a kind</a> bags, we were given the crumbly leftovers and an extra ready-made packet, for those who want to preserve their creations. _Awesome_.

Leaving the Chicken Factory, we grabbed some lunch at the Noodles Bazaar. A cafeteria with noodle dishes heralding from all over the world. Of course I had to try their take of Vietnam’s phở. I knew it wasn't going to be great but I still had to try. As expected, it wasn't good. The broth lacked a lot of flavour and the two miserable pieces of “beef” only exemplified my prejudices.

With time back on our side, we explored the rest of the museum. There are a lot of wonderful exhibits dotted around the beautifully modern space, especially the chronological noodle gallery. Of course, we couldn’t leave without visiting the gift store. There was a fair amount of worthy and well-priced offerings. I just wish there was more <sup><sup>for me to buy</sup></sup>.

Exiting the museum, Wilson departed from the group to visit <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Sens%C5%8D-ji/@35.7147651,139.7944666,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188ec1a4463df1:0x6c0d289a8292810d!8m2!3d35.7147651!4d139.7966553?hl=en">Asakusa Senso-ji</a> (spoiler alert, he didn't. Surprise, surprise, he lazed at home the whole time). As for us, we returned to the Mirai 21 area until evening. Again, we've barely scratched the surface of what this wonderful city has to offer (like the _ramen_ museum) and definitely warrants more visits.

Returning to Tokyo, we gave Harajuku a slightly more thorough visit; it's better when half of the district isn't closed. Strolling the down the roads, we encountered a footpath chock full of food stalls and customers eager for a bite. As I followed my nose towards the savoury smells, I soon followed my stomach’s desire for some sweet crêpes.

Splitting off again, Carolyn and I visited _another_ paradise of mine: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Tsutaya+Daikanyama/@35.6488531,139.6976021,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60188b4fc6ac5b49:0x4ceb5b05b48bad60!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188b4fbed0f881:0xd6f9dafad72a5ca9!8m2!3d35.6488531!4d139.6997908?hl=en">Tsutaya Daikanyama (T-Site)</a>. A jaw dropping-ly gorgeous bookstore, both inside and out. Not exclusively a book store though, they also have to offer: movies, music, a café and many lounge spaces, to enjoy the books before purchasing (and that’s just a fraction of things available). I _reaaaaaally_ want one of these in Adelaide. Every other bookstore just pales in comparison. The vast range and collections available, the elegant wood architecture and the peacefulness – it was just _perfect_.

If only I was born into richness, I’d be able bring back shelves worth of books 🤤. What’s also really great about this Tsutaya is that it opens until 2:00! But!... we didn’t have the luxury to do that (trains not operational and all).

Being late in the night, I forewent regrouping and returned straight home. Getting a good night’s rest, I needed to be ready for tomorrow’s giant tour. Bouncing around Tokyo, I was going to visit all the BIC Cameras, i.e. The BICest Tour. Thank you for reading and join me next time.
