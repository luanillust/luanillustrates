<a href="https://youtu.be/E8gmARGvPlI?t=18s">Last Christmas</a>, I was baking in the sweltering hot heat of Australia. This year, to save me from tears, I submitted myself to the cold climate of Japan. Oh noooo… _how terrible_...

Coming off the normie train, we waited for a charming French man to come collect us. Rocking up in a mini-van, we sped off to our accommodation. I looked to <a href="http://hakubalodge.com/">Hakuba Snowdrift Lodge</a> for our snowy needs, based on word of mouth of a friend. And… I can’t say that I would revisit if I ever returned. That's not to say that it's a terrible place or anything; it's just not for me.

The staff are great, the in-house food was fantastic and the community couldn’t be any better. My gripes were that: the lodge wasn't the cleanest, a handful of bugs ran wild in the room and the hygienic facilities were lacking. Adding to that, the place was a fair distance away from the slopes, but the free buses made up for that -ish.

Staff weren't available until later, for the required orientation. This left us to loosely roam around the sparse encompassing area. Returning to the lodge, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that a bunch of the staff journeyed from Adelaide! It seemed that everyone we bumped into was Australian: the gear hire guys, staff at _both_ of the lodges and the countless ones skiing alongside us. It was like never leaving home, a mini Australia if you will.

Thinking orientation was late, collecting our gear didn't happen until much later. Leaving us to lose an arvo on the slopes :confused:. Disappointed with our place of residence, it compounded further when shown the rental clothes. The range was limited to ugly and unsightly, and sizing was meant for a future jacked <sup><sup>or obese</sup></sup> me. Normally an S, I ended up looking like a hobo with my Ls and XLs :worried:.

Later that Christmas night, we partied like animals (and by we, I mean not me). With newfound friends, they went loooong into the night while I went deep into slumber.

As the sun ushered in the new day, the guys left for their sole lesson, while the rest of us proceeded straight to the slopes :grimacing:. Up until the cable car ride up, I was feeling unnerved; though it didn’t take long for them to kick in.

Without stacking it, I managed to manoeuvre myself on the flat surfaces (if you call clumsily slipping back and forth "manoeuvring"). Building up a false confidence, I inched closer towards the slopes. Throwing myself in the deep end would surely help. Right? :clap: Okay. ~10mins of YouTube tutorials, show me what you got. :ski:

I was doing... surprisingly well. As expected, I fell over a couple <sup><sup>hundred</sup></sup> times but it was nothing bone breaking (pride, maaaaybe). With true confidence, I made a few more runs - not without me torpedoing right into the snow, of course. At many stages, my camera was completely caked with snow. Yay for weather sealing (thanks, Fujifilm <sup>_sponsor me_</sup>).

It was fun... you know, when I could actually keep myself up. Other than that, I hate skiing with a passion. The skis are awkwardly long and messed with my legs far too often; especially when I needed to get back up after the inevitable falls. And my shins... my poor bruised shins.

After some decent runs, I realised that I hadn't seen the girls this whole time and I had no way to contact them. Slightly worried, I made my way back up in hopes to find them. Seeing Carolyn’s backpack left me at ease, knowing that they have yet to leave me. Plonking myself down, I sat waiting for their arrival. 

...

A fair bit of time passed and there still wasn't any sign of them. Sliding about, I found them around the corner away from the slopes... building a meagre little snowman… I- 

:no_mouth:

Returning to the slopes the next day, I left my camera behind to focus on skiing (a <a href="https://youtu.be/46Kv4rBJi68?t=1s">huge mistake</a>...). It was as if I became a new person; I couldn’t make it 2 metres without stacking it _hard_. Like a corrupted save file, whatever progress I made yesterday was lost. Making things more embarrassing, I always managed to end up veering towards the ski lifts, where every fall was observable to the skiers/snowboarders and to those swinging above :persevere:. Oh and don’t forget the little groups of kids that would casually woosh pass <sup>_huge_ boost for the ego</sup>.

It got so bad that multiple people on multiple occasions stopped to check if I was okay :confounded:. One of the falls was so bad that I just laid there, motionless from the pain - of embarrassment. Yesterday, I was stopping myself with the skis like: / \ and I thought to try and brake like the pros: \ \ to / /. It was ridiculous to think this was going to go well. Lurching forward on my face, I proceeded to roll onto my back and, like a snow angel, slid down the slope...

I barely made 3 runs, while the others went on and on... :cry: Should've snowboarded - no, wait... I should've gone sledding! _That (with my camera) would’ve been perfect_.

The body battering marked the end of our time on the slopes. Bags ready and packed, I holed up in the lodge ready for the sun to shine on the new Tomorrowbe. day was going to be the start of the Tokyo leg :smiley:. But that also meant the end of the trip… :worried:. Thanks for reading and come along with me next time, as I get my <a href="https://youtu.be/t3ULhmadHkg?t=1m13s">cray on</a>.
